They’ve branded Meghan Markle’s thinking as ‘delusional’ for ‘underestimating’ The Firm.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Meghan Markle</a> has been criticized by a relationship expert for “underestimating” The Firm when she got married for the second time. The expert has claimed the <a href=#>royal</a> would have understood the scrutiny she faced after tying the knot with the Duke of Sussex. Therefore, the expert slammed this way of thinking from Meghan Markle as ‘delusional’. Following <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and Meghan’s sudden exit as working royals, they carved out a new life in Los Angeles. Since then, fans and social media across the world have been watching their every move.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-markle-s-wish-branded-simply-delusional>Meghan Markle’s wish branded ‘simply delusional’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1053032052-1024x683.jpg><p>Relationship expert Kate Mansfield has weighed on the aftermath of the Sussexes’ stepping down in 2020.</p><p>She didn’t hold back when she explained the former <a href=#>TV</a> star “completely underestimated the reality” of what it means to marry a royal. She went as far as claiming Meghan Markle’s wish of privacy was ‘delusional’.</p><p>Mansfield <a href=# rel=nofollow>told</a> GB News: “I think that one of the reasons that Meghan has had so much negative press is that she seems to have completely underestimated the reality of what it means to be married into the Royal Family.</p><p>“Wanting privacy and to have her way about things is simply delusional.</p><p>“For the common person looking in, although we might have some sympathy for the invasion of privacy, the fact that she married into such huge privilege counters this.”</p><p>However, in terms of advice for the <a href=#>Suits actress</a>, Mansfield only had one thing to say.</p><p>“Meghan will likely have to suck it up and bear it,” were the words of wisdom from the expert.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-and-harry-embraced-by-the-celebrity-world>Meghan and Harry embraced by the celebrity world</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/08/GettyImages-1307563566-1024x844.jpg><p>It comes after a friend of Meghan’s dad, Thomas Markle, almost shattered their dreams of a quiet life in California.</p><p>A royal and <a href=#>celebrity</a> sightseeing tour promised to transport passengers right in front of the duo’s Montecito mansion. Fans were expected to splash out $1,200 for the price for six people. This would have been in a bid to get a glance of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s home. Aside from the mansion, they’d see their favorite hotspots in the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> town.</p><p>The trips were first advertised as the Royal Celebrity Tour of Los Angeles and Montecito. They were also going to be run by a pal of Meghan’s estranged father, Karl Larsen</p><p>In a trip down memory lane, fans were going to be taken to see nostalgic areas. For instance, the polo club where the Duchess – mom to <a href=#>Archie</a> and Lilibet – kissed Harry last year. There were also set visits to her favorite shops and restaurants.</p><p>The trip has since been scrapped after only a few days of it being online.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tour-s-fiery-backlash>Tour’s fiery backlash</h2><p>Karl Larsen initially listed the tour on Tripening with the description: “I’m the world-famous celebrity photographer Karl Larsen, a best friend of Thomas Markle (Meghan’s father) and the guy with a stunning exclusive portfolio of pictures of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle together in Montecito.”</p><p>However, tech entrepreneur Christopher Bouzy spoke out and criticized the tour. He told Newsweek it was an act of “targeted harassment” at the royal pair before it was taken down.</p><p>Bouzy had slammed the tour after the news first came out. He said: “The problematic listing was an act of targeted harassment, and it jeopardized the safety of the Duke and Duchess’s family.</p><p>“The rise in online harassment underscores the urgent need for robust legislation to counteract this escalating problem that affects everyone.”</p><p>The tour was axed by the travel firm it was advertised on following concerns over privacy.</p><p>Larsen then clarified to the outlet that he didn’t plan to drive past <a href=#>Harry and Meghan’s mansion</a>.</p><p>Despite the backlash, and the tour being removed, Larsen said it is “not going to be the end.” Designed for true fans, he compared it to <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a> fans visiting Graceland. He explained he’d like the tour to focus on the areas where they’ve been seen and where she grew up.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2WDcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y56qZqWZqMGit8Rmpp9lp5a7tbXNoGStp12drrexjKGcq2WnlsZuw8CsZJ2dnKrAqrvNmqNmnailsrPAjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmeghan-markles-mistake-of-wanting-to-have-her-way-was-delusional-expert.html&text=Meghan%20Markle%27s%20mistake%20of%20%27wanting%20to%20have%20her%20way%27%20was%20%27delusional%27%20-%20expert&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmeghan-markles-mistake-of-wanting-to-have-her-way-was-delusional-expert.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmeghan-markles-mistake-of-wanting-to-have-her-way-was-delusional-expert.html&title=Meghan%20Markle%27s%20mistake%20of%20%27wanting%20to%20have%20her%20way%27%20was%20%27delusional%27%20-%20expert" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmeghan-markles-mistake-of-wanting-to-have-her-way-was-delusional-expert.html&title=Meghan%20Markle%27s%20mistake%20of%20%27wanting%20to%20have%20her%20way%27%20was%20%27delusional%27%20-%20expert" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmeghan-markles-mistake-of-wanting-to-have-her-way-was-delusional-expert.html&title=Meghan%20Markle%27s%20mistake%20of%20%27wanting%20to%20have%20her%20way%27%20was%20%27delusional%27%20-%20expert" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmeghan-markles-mistake-of-wanting-to-have-her-way-was-delusional-expert.html&description=Meghan%20Markle%27s%20mistake%20of%20%27wanting%20to%20have%20her%20way%27%20was%20%27delusional%27%20-%20expert" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./2022-02-02-020222-savannah-chrisley-911-1354064.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Savannah Chrisley Frantic on 911 Call as She and Todd Try to Help Suicidal Ex BF">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./543850-list-tribes-tanzania-languages-home-regions.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="List of all tribes in Tanzania with their languages and home regions">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
