Around the age of four, Christopher Bosh began to fall in love with basketball after watching and following his father at pick-up games. However, it was not until the fourth grade that he began to learn and actively play basketball. He also played baseball but focused on basketball when he entered high school.</p><p>Bosh attended Lincoln High School in Dallas, where he excelled both academically and athletically. He graduated with honors and also led his school to the number one spot in the country by helping it win the USA Today National Championship with a perfect season of 40 wins and zero losses. His performances during the season earned him numerous awards, including Basketball America’s High School Player of the Year, Texas’ Powerade Player of the Year, an All-American from Parade’s first team, McDonald’s and EA Sports, and the title of “Mr. Basketball.</p><p>With all these achievements, many colleges tried to recruit the rising star. However, Bosh chose Georgia Tech to study computer imaging, graphic design, and management. In the sporting arena, he admired the transition offensive of the school’s basketball team, but most of all he felt that their coach, Paul Hewitt, would look after his interests and help him play professional basketball. It also helped him that his cousin and aunt were both former students of the school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chris-Bosh-Bio.jpg><p>In his first season as a rookie on the team, Bosh averaged 15.6 points, 9.0 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks in 31 games. He also led the Atlantic Coast Conference in terms of percentage of field goals, making him one of only two newcomers ever to achieve this. After that year, Bosh decided to leave college and play professional basketball by joining the NBA Draft in 2003. He was selected by the Toronto Raptors with the fourth overall selection. Bosh’s future teammates from the Miami Heat, Lebron James, and Dwayne Wade, as well as Carmelo Anthony, were selected before him.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Ryan Haywood Wife, Kids, Family, Net Worth, Height, Age, Bio</a></strong></p><p>In his rookie season, Bosh, who played the strong forward position, was played from his normal position as the center, but still managed to average 11.5 points, 7.4 rebounds, 1.4 blocks, and 33.5 minutes in 75 games and led all rookies in rebounds and blocks. He also set a franchise record for the most rebounds in a rookie season. His performance did not go unnoticed, as he was rewarded with the inclusion in the NBA All-Rookie First Team for the 2003/04 season. His coaches talked a lot about him during this time and praised him for his willingness to play despite pain and injuries.</p><p>The following year, Bosh was named leader of the team after Vince Carter retired. That year, he improved all his statistics, which led to his first-ever NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week title. He ended the 2004-05 season as the team’s top scorer and leading rebounder.</p><p>From then on, Bosh grew from height to height; he led the team in various categories, was selected for the All-Star Games, and joined the All-NBA teams. By 2010, Bosh had become the all-time leader of the Toronto Raptors in total points and doubles in a season. He was also one of two players in the league to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds per game.</p><p>At the end of this season, he decided to part with the franchise and sign a trade agreement with the Miami Heat. Chris Bosh became part of the newly formed Big Three in Miami and teamed up with James and Wade. In his first season in South Beach, Bosh and the Heat won 58 games in the regular 82-game season. In the playoffs, Miami beat Philadelphia, Boston, and Chicago to reach the finals. There they fell to Dallas, although they led the series 2-1.</p><p>The following season, Bosh and his teammates did everything they could to beat Oklahoma City Thunder, winning his first-ever NBA championship. The following season, he became the consecutive NBA championship winner after Miami defeated the San Antonio Spurs in the 2012-13 season.</p><p>In the 2013-14 season, The Heat made it back to the finals, once again meeting last year’s finalist, the Spurs. This time, they lost the series in five games, which led to the end of the Big Three era in Miami. Bosh resigned at Miami after Lebron James decided to leave the team, but was struck by injuries that affected his season. He overcame the injuries, however, only to be diagnosed two months later with a blood clot in one of his lungs, which ruled him out for the season.</p><h3><strong>Health, Illness</strong></h3><p>After Chris Bosh had interrupted the season to get treatment for a blood clot in his lung, he returned the following season in November 2015 to pick up where he left off. He scored a season-high of 30 points in a win against the Los Angeles Lakers, another season-high of 31 points and 11 rebounds in a win against the Indiana Pacers.</p><p>In 2016, however, Bosh was diagnosed with another blood clot in his leg after failing a medical test. He sat out the rest of the season and was later released from his contract with the Heat. Out of respect, Heat president Pat Riley said no other player would ever wear Bosh’s jersey as number one.</p><p>“The number one will never be worn by another player and we can’t wait to hang his jersey up in the rafters one day,” Riley said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Chris-Bosh-With-Family.jpg><h2><strong>Family (Wife, Kids, Gay?)</strong></h2><p>Chris Bosh is happily married to Adrienne Williams. The couple married in 2011 and have four children; three sons (Dylan, Jackson, Lennox) and one daughter (Phoenix) together. Bosh also has a daughter (Trinity) from a previous relationship.</p><p>His sexuality has been questioned in the past, and rumor has it that the 5’8″ baller is gay. Bosh exposed these rumors by saying he was straight before admitting that he has a brother and some partners who are gay.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Burak Ozcivit Wife, Body Measurements, 5 Facts About The Turkish Actor</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Chris Bosh’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>The net worth of Chris Bosh is estimated at 50 million dollars. This is due to his annual salary of about $23.7 million per year. He has also signed a number of advertising contracts, most recently with Janssen Pharmaceuticals for their blood thinner Xarelto after his fight against blood clots.</p><p>Bosh has established the Chris Bosch Foundation, which helps young people in Toronto and Dallas with academics and athletes.</p><h2><strong>Quick Facts</strong></h2><p><strong>Birth Name:</strong>&nbsp;Christopher Wesson Bosh</p><p><strong>Birth Date:</strong>&nbsp;March 24, 1984</p><p><strong>Place of Birth:</strong>&nbsp;Dallas, Texas, United States</p><p><strong>Profession:</strong>&nbsp;Basketball Player</p><p><strong>Nationality:</strong>&nbsp;American</p><p><strong>Sun Sign:</strong>&nbsp;Aries</p><p><strong>Height:</strong>&nbsp;6 ft 11 in (2.11 m)</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;235&nbsp;lb (107&nbsp;kg)</p><p><strong>Net Worth:</strong>&nbsp;$50 Million</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ksKm%2ByKxkm6ejnXq4tcWeZKShlKh6qK3YZqWerF2svLPAx2afnpmcqbVutculpZ6ro2K1prXGoato</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fchris-bosh-wife-kids-gay-net-worth-health-illness-height.html&text=Chris%20Bosh%20Wife%2c%20Kids%2c%20Gay%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Health%2c%20Illness%2c%20Height&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchris-bosh-wife-kids-gay-net-worth-health-illness-height.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchris-bosh-wife-kids-gay-net-worth-health-illness-height.html&title=Chris%20Bosh%20Wife%2c%20Kids%2c%20Gay%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Health%2c%20Illness%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fchris-bosh-wife-kids-gay-net-worth-health-illness-height.html&title=Chris%20Bosh%20Wife%2c%20Kids%2c%20Gay%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Health%2c%20Illness%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fchris-bosh-wife-kids-gay-net-worth-health-illness-height.html&title=Chris%20Bosh%20Wife%2c%20Kids%2c%20Gay%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Health%2c%20Illness%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchris-bosh-wife-kids-gay-net-worth-health-illness-height.html&description=Chris%20Bosh%20Wife%2c%20Kids%2c%20Gay%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Health%2c%20Illness%2c%20Height" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./patti-smith-style.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Inspired by Patti Smith's Fierce Androgyny">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bill-to-remove-statute-of-limitations-for-sexual-battery-passes-121-0.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bill to remove statute of limitations for sexual battery passes 121-0 | Free News">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
