"You really just have to be present to your moments. He's gonna feel different, different times as he grows and I just have to be present to it. There's no real preparation, it's just being present to the moments."</p><p>"I have tons of pictures and videos," she continued. "Even last night, I showed him stuff of his dad and when we first met, it keeps him inquisitive and he has a lot of questions but it's perfect because he knows what his dad looks like, and its good to be able to connect yourself with your father and to show him that means a lot."</p><p>As SJ gets older, Simmons said she's starting to so much of the boy's father in him, down to his mannerisms.</p><p>"His dad used to be on me if it's not super organized, like OCD and I already see it in my son," she said.

"It's just as he grows," she explained, "it's what his mind can handle in those moments."</p><p>Until then, her focus is "being strong within myself," meaning therapy and getting her "spiritual life in order" so she can be the best mom she can be for her son. "If I'm not good, I can't do what I need to do as a mother," she said, adding that she's "making sure I'm solid."</p><p>To any other single parents out there in a similar situation, she said it's just important to be present and keep family members close who can keep the other parent's memory alive.</p><p>"[But] even if you don't have that, you're good enough, knowing that you're good enough, God put you here to be good enough, you're great, you can do it," she added.
