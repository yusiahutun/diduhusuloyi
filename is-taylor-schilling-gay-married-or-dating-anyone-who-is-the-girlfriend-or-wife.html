The acclaimed actress’s sexuality has sparked much debate lately, and all signs point to the fact that the whispers and speculation that are creeping about her sexual preferences could become a harsh reality in the near future.</p><p>In 2013, Taylor’s role as Piper Chapman in Orange Is the New Black – a Netflix series earned her a satellite award for best actress in a television series. She was also twice nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – TV Series Drama and Best Actress – TV Series Musical or Comedy. Taylor was also nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Leading Actress in a Comedy Series.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>7 Interesting Things To Know About The British Actor Kenneth Branagh</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Early Life and Background Info</strong></h3><p>The American actress belongs to the white ethnic group. She was born on July 27, 1984, in Boston, Massachusetts, the daughter of her father Robert J. Schilling, who worked as a prosecutor, and her mother Patricia Schilling (née Miller), an MIT administrator. Taylor Schilling has one sibling, a younger brother named Sam Schilling. Her parents divorced when she was very young, so she had to divide her time to move from one parent to the other – from Roxbury to Wayland during her formative years. The young star is a die-hard fan of the NBC medical drama ER and began acting at a very young age.</p><p>A closer look at her educational background revealed that she attended Wayland High School and graduated in 2002. After high school, she went to Fordham University, where she graduated with a bachelor’s degree in art in 2006. During her years at both schools, she worked in theater productions, and to hone her acting skills, she enrolled in a graduate program at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. She was there until her second year when she left school to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. Taylor Schilling took a job as a nanny for a family in Manhattan to earn a living while she waited for her big break.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is Taylor Schilling Gay?</strong></h2><p>Taylor’s sexuality has always been a source of constant debate for critics and fans alike, but to this day it has not been clarified. According to some sources, she had some active romantic relationships with the opposite sex during her college years, but Taylor Schilling has refused to either refute or confirm this assertion.</p><p>On the other hand, she has been secretly whispered that she is either bisexual or homosexual because she has a friend named Carrie Brownstein, an American-born musician and actress to whom she is very close, but the details of this particular relationship have remained a mystery to the public. Nonetheless, Taylor Schilling relationship with Carrie is believed to have been strong for more than a few years. Some sources even stated that it has existed since March 2015 and came to public attention in August 2015, but none of the parties involved have confirmed or disproved this.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Who Is Bill Pullman, Is He Dead Or Alive? His Wife, Net Worth And Education</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Is She Married or Dating Anyone, Who is The Girlfriend or Wife?</strong></h2><p>The popular actress, for her part, is a private person who cares about her personal affairs. So far she has not shown any particular interest in settling down with a married man, and having children seems to be very far from her immediate plans. Although she has confirmed in an interview that she loves children, she is not yet ready to have children. In fact, Taylor Schilling believes that she will have plenty of time to have children when she is ready.</p><p>As for the ambiguity of her sexual preferences, Taylor Schilling herself complicated the situation even further when she said in an interview that she is an expansive person by nature and has experienced very serious relationships with several people. She went on to say that no part of her can be put under a label and she cannot be reduced to fit into a box. Her concluding remark that she had experienced a lot of love and did not care where it came from made tongues wagging over her vague sexuality.</p><p>Another fact about Taylor Schilling is that she is interested in the practice of Transcendental Meditation, which further confuses fans about who she really is. On several occasions, she showed signs of being with Carrie, but when asked, she replied that she doesn’t like to date, giving her usual quote that it takes a lot to be in love with someone. Recently, she revealed that she is single and that if she found the right partner, she would not hesitate to let fans and the public know. She claims to be a monogamist who is looking for a criminal partner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ktrR505qwpaeiYsCktMilo6Kml2K0osWMppirqpmasW670WabmqyZo7Rurc2ypqedXay1sHnIrGStoJVitKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXqwvoywoJ%2BdXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-taylor-schilling-gay-married-or-dating-anyone-who-is-the-girlfriend-or-wife.html&text=Is%20Taylor%20Schilling%20Gay%2c%20Married%20or%20Dating%20Anyone%2c%20Who%20is%20The%20Girlfriend%20or%20Wife&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-taylor-schilling-gay-married-or-dating-anyone-who-is-the-girlfriend-or-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-taylor-schilling-gay-married-or-dating-anyone-who-is-the-girlfriend-or-wife.html&title=Is%20Taylor%20Schilling%20Gay%2c%20Married%20or%20Dating%20Anyone%2c%20Who%20is%20The%20Girlfriend%20or%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-taylor-schilling-gay-married-or-dating-anyone-who-is-the-girlfriend-or-wife.html&title=Is%20Taylor%20Schilling%20Gay%2c%20Married%20or%20Dating%20Anyone%2c%20Who%20is%20The%20Girlfriend%20or%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-taylor-schilling-gay-married-or-dating-anyone-who-is-the-girlfriend-or-wife.html&title=Is%20Taylor%20Schilling%20Gay%2c%20Married%20or%20Dating%20Anyone%2c%20Who%20is%20The%20Girlfriend%20or%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-taylor-schilling-gay-married-or-dating-anyone-who-is-the-girlfriend-or-wife.html&description=Is%20Taylor%20Schilling%20Gay%2c%20Married%20or%20Dating%20Anyone%2c%20Who%20is%20The%20Girlfriend%20or%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./justin-dior-combs-gay-girlfriend-dating-siblings-mother-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Justin Dior Combs, Obscure Dating Life - Results Gay Speculations">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-to-watch-how-i-met-your-father.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Watch How I Met Your Father Online Free: Where to Stream 'HIMYF'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
