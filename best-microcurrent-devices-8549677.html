The payoff? A <strong>firmer-looking jawline</strong>, more <strong>sculpted cheekbones</strong>, and all-around <strong>more defined face</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Now, these devices are available to the rest of us, and an at-home <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>microcurrent facial</a> may be the key to a more youthful appearance with just a few minutes a day. They use tiny electrical currents, a.k.a. the microcurrents in question, to trigger changes in skin. “Microcurrent devices <strong>deliver an electrical current to the muscles</strong> and skin cells, which upregulates intracellular ATP – the energy driver of the skin,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Dr. Melanie Palm</a>, a board-certified dermatologist in San Diego, CA. “This is what results in a temporary <strong>toning and lifting effect</strong>.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To figure out what really worked, we recruited 14 InStyle editors to test 14 microcurrent devices, integrating them into their regular wellness routines for <strong>eight weeks</strong>. We spent a collective <strong>448 hours testing</strong>, assessing <strong>how easy they were to use</strong>, along with the amount of<strong> handy high-tech features</strong> each design offered, and, most importantly, the <strong>visible results</strong> we saw on our faces at the end of eight weeks — did our jawlines look more chiseled? Were our cheekbones lifted to the high heavens? Out of the 14 microcurrent devices, you'll only find the creme de la creme on this list.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-microcurrent-facial-device-nuface-trinity-starter-kit-with-eye-and-lip-attachment></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall Microcurrent Facial Device</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>NuFace Trinity+ Starter Kit</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="NuFace Trinity+ Starter Kit with Eye and Lip Attachment" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qrxIhNRfKTuPMvjbmeVIdkvgbAY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/trinity-74c818ddf0704343b4b86c390a3f94f4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>NuFace</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It offers instant gratification, and couldn’t be easier to use.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The results don’t last more than a few hours.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're new to microcurrent devices, no sweat: We found the NuFace Trinity+ to be <strong>so self-explanatory</strong> that you could probably use it without reading the directions (although we still did). After a <strong>quick charge </strong>in the dock — which, we should add, was small enough to fit on our limited bathroom-counter space — we used the device for about five to 10 minutes, allowing the <strong>built-in timer beeps </strong>to guide the treatment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We <strong>didn't feel any discomfort even on the strongest setting </strong>— unless the conductive gel dried up, which is why the directions say to apply as you go (oops). It gave our skin a slightly<strong> lifted look</strong> and <strong>tighter feel right after the treatment</strong>, and while the effect lasted through dinner, it didn't last for days. We'd use it again for a night out. And it was <strong>so comfortable</strong> that we actually enjoyed it as a moment to zone out. We also liked that it <strong>came with attachments</strong> to treat the lip and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>eye areas</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But again, the results are incredibly subtle. So as long as you set your expectations accordingly and see it for what it is — a <strong>self-care moment</strong> with a temporary payoff — then you might love it, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>FDA Cleared: </strong>Yes <strong>| Usage: </strong>Apply the activator gel to clean, dry skin.

Intrigued? We were.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We were hoping to reduce our forehead and smile lines, so we used it <strong>across our entire face</strong>. We loved the <strong>included conductive gel</strong>, which wasn't sticky, didn't evaporate, and allowed for a <strong>smooth glide</strong>. We also found the <strong>shape of the device ideal </strong>for getting into all the nooks and crannies of our face, like under the brow bone and beneath the eyes, without any extra attachments. After downloading the Ziip app, we set out to do the 30-day challenge, for which the treatments lasted anywhere between four to 10 minutes. Not only did our skin <strong>look smooth and lifted right after one use</strong> (think "snatched") but the effect actually <strong>lasted a few days,</strong> and we noticed that our<strong> jawline looked significantly more sculpted</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only hiccup we encountered was that the usage info was confusing and overwhelming; it came with multiple inserts and a huge user guide, and we found that the instructions in the manual were different than those on an insert card. And we didn't even realize until midway through our first treatment that we were only supposed to treat one side of our face at a time. But the fact that it actually <strong>gave us long-lasting results</strong> made it a winner in our books.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>FDA Cleared: </strong>Yes&nbsp;<strong>| Usage: </strong>Apply the activator gel to clean, dry skin.

It comes with <strong>several attachments,</strong> a microcurrent cream, and an app that walked us through the different areas to target and how to treat them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We liked that it's similar to the Theragun (the brand's best-selling massage tool) in that it <strong>fits nicely in the hand</strong> and <strong>comes with a storage case</strong>. And we <strong>really, really loved its versatility</strong>: We used the microcurrent setting as well as the cleansing attachment to cleanse at night and the LED lights to target our acne spots. By the time we finished testing, <strong>our skin looked tighter, toned, and all-around more sculpted</strong>, and we saw a <strong>big improvement in our acne</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Each session takes about five minutes (although it can vary slightly) so depending on how many things you want to do with it, the time can add up fast — leading to a longer-than-usual <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>morning skincare routine</a>. But we found it worthwhile for the results.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>FDA Cleared: </strong>Yes&nbsp;<strong>| Usage: </strong>Working in sections, move the tool across skin, following the contours of the face.&nbsp;<strong>| Microcurrent Levels: </strong>1&nbsp;<strong>| Additional Features: </strong>Multiple attachments, including LED lights, a cleansing ring, and percussive therapy</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-affordable-microcurrent-device-solawave-4-in-1-skincare-wand-with-red-light-therapy></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Affordable Microcurrent Device</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Solawave 4-in-1 Skincare Wand with Red Light Therapy</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ulta Solawave 4-in-1 Skincare Wand with Red Light Therapy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/mqHjucfEHqlE92PxHqwfA6-uZ4c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Solawave-4-in-1-Skincare-Wand-with-Red-Light-Therapy-06f3053bea4940bd8210da8706ece7a6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The warmth from the device was really soothing on skin.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> Each session takes 12 minutes and can get tiresome.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rather than using microcurrent, this little wand uses <strong>LED light therapy</strong>, which can is known to <strong>help even out skin tone, smooth fine lines, and even tackle blemishes</strong>. On top of that, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Solawave</a> also has a galvanic current, which is a<strong> low form of energy</strong> that <strong>helps skin better absorb skincare </strong>products. Since we were dealing with blemishes, dullness, and wrinkles, we could hoping this could tackle all of the above.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We loved how <strong>easy the Solawave was to use</strong> — just turn it on and glide it along your skin. The <strong>head is also on a swivel</strong>, which makes it <strong>easy to reach smaller areas</strong>. Immediately after using it, our <strong>skin looked plumper </strong>and <strong>smoother</strong>. We saw the biggest difference in our under-eye area; our <strong>under-eye bags were less pronounced</strong>, and it seemed to <strong>tone down the puffiness</strong>. It also helped <strong>reduce the discoloration</strong> and <strong>redness</strong> around our nose, and the warmth from the wand felt amazing when our skin was inflamed from allergies.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, it didn't do much for our acne, and we got bored during the 12 minute-long sessions. The results also never lasted longer than a few hours, and we were most vexed by the fact that there's no indicator light to show whether the device is fully charged or not.

We did have to dial down the intensity, though; it comes with strength and intensity levels between 1 and 10, and found that the level 4 gave us a strong, not painful but not comfortable, zap that made us tear up. But the morning after using it, <strong>our face looked so much more defined</strong> and sculpted, <strong>especially in our cheeks</strong>.

We were hoping to get a similar <strong>chiseled effect</strong> from this — while, of course, being realistic about the limitations of at-home devices. Off the bat, the <strong>device is pretty foolproof</strong>; set-up was easy and quick, and we were able to use this on our cheeks, jawline, and neck in about five to 10 minutes every day. We <strong>used it on the highest setting</strong>, on which we'd occasionally feel a slight shock (think a rubber band snap), but found it otherwise <strong>pretty comfortable</strong>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We saw an<strong> immediate difference</strong> in our skin, which looked <strong>more lifted and less puffy</strong>.

It was our first time using a microcurrent device, so it took us awhile to get used to the sensations, which <strong>felt strong </strong>even on the lowest setting. (That said, it was more discomfort than pain.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After using it with the included gel on our cheeks, forehead, and jawline, <strong>our face was visibly brighter </strong>and <strong>less puffy </strong>— <strong>every single time</strong> we used it.

We started to get antsy around the 10-minute mark. On top of that, we were surprised that it wasn't rechargeable, but required AAA batteries, which weren't included (and which we didn't have on hand). Even so, we plan to keep it in our rotation to use in the days leading up to a big event.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>FDA Cleared: </strong>No&nbsp;<strong>| Usage: </strong>Apply the activator serum to clean, dry skin.

As a face roller, we loved the results: It smoothed our puffiness and slimmed down our face, giving us not just a puff-free appearance, but also a newly <strong>sculpted jawline</strong> and <strong>higher, lifted cheekbones.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But we're not totally sure how the microcurrent played in here: The device supposedly is charged via a tiny solar panel on the top of the device.

If you don’t want to spring for one from the brand, a water-based gel without many filler ingredients, like an aloe vera gel, can be a good option.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do microcurrent devices work?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They do, if you use them right. “At-home microcurrent devices are not as effective or impactful as in-office microcurrent treatments, but with consistency and time, they can offer a temporary toning and lifting effect,” says Dr. Palm. But again, it’s important to temper your expectations accordingly. They’re not going to give you the same results as, say, a procedure at your doctor’s office.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Do dermatologists recommend micorcurrent?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">They do, although it depends on the patient. “I recommend them to patients who are willing to commit to the time and consistency required to see an improvement,” says Dr. Palm. “They’re generally safe and well-tolerated by most skin types.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Can you overdo microcurrent?<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The at-home microcurrent devices are generally really safe and hard to overuse, according to Dr. Castilla. If you do manage to overuse it, you might get skin irritation, pain, or tingling — but if you follow the directions, this shouldn't happen.
