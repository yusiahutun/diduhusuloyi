There are plenty of relaxers available in the market with a tag of regular and super. However, before you pick the strength of the formula, you need to determine the hair type and texture.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>b) Hair Type: </strong>Before you choose the right hair relaxer, determine your hair type. Hair type generally ranges from 1-4 with subcategories ranging from A to C. Your hair type must go with the relaxer’s formula in order to get the best results.</p><p><strong>c) Hair Texture: </strong>If your strands are thin and appear fine, you should choose a formula that is not too strong.
