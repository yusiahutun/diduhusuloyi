Let's find out.</p><h2>Scooter Gennett-Caring and Loving Husband</h2><p>There are a lot of players, who generally prioratize their sports more than anything, and it's a good sign as well. But they end up isolating their better half, leading up to a disastrous marriage life.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2017/06/csvmehoukaa2qad.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Scooter and his wife lives together with their adorable dog</p><p>But Scooter knows how to handle his professional and personal life in a balanced way. The <strong>27-years-old</strong> second baseman believes in putting wife in the number 1 priority list.</p><p>In an interview, he divulged,&nbsp;</p><p>"It’s tough. I’m not going to lie. It’s not easy. It’s priorities. My belief is if you get married, your wife or spouse should be No. 1."</p><p>According to him, if you're aiming for big leagues and you're married, then you need to sort out your prioraties sooner before its too late, for his&nbsp;career as well as marriage.</p><p>In the same interview, he added,&nbsp;</p><p>"If you have priorities that are above playing in the big leagues, usually that doesn’t work out. I think it’s a little easier for the guys that maybe get married later in their career, after they’re already established."</p><p>One thing that separates him from the crowd would be his focused, down to earth and realistic target. He accepts the fact that after getting married, he won't be able to practise much as he has different priorities.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedwiki.com/uploads/2017/06/scootermarriedosbcvu6575765pvw.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>They tied the knot in a private ceremony surrounded by their 20 relatives, Source: MLB</p><p>Scooter married <strong>Kelsey Gennett</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>wed on</a> April 2015, in a content ceremony surround by 20 of their closest friends and relatives.
