The sandwiches were elegantly crafted – marinated cucumber with lemon & sour cream, salmon gravlax with a hint of sweet mustard and dill as well as egg mayonnaise with fine herbs and truffle in a brioche bun. The scones were warm, crumbly, and served with clotted cream and strawberry jam.</p><p>New additions include a christmas pudding crème patisserie, the mulled tea 'Drink Me' potion, a snowman lemon pavlova and gingerbread cookie.

The best bit about Lucky Voice? You get your own room to hire. So, if you get a little stage fright, the private room means other people won't hear you giving it your all to Taylor Swift.</p><p>&nbsp;I've been to Lucky Voice a few times now and compared to other karaoke bars, it really does have the upper hand. The collection of songs is extensive. Even if your music taste is niche, there are so many artists, playlists and songs to choose from that everyone will want to grab the mic at some point throughout the evening.</p><p>The staff are great, too. Too busy singing I Will Survive to head to the bar? No problem. Just push the button in your room and a server will come and take your order.</p><p>&nbsp;So, whether it's a big birthday, a Christmas work party, or simply a wild Saturday night with your besties, Lucky Voice will always provide a brilliant night out.</p><p>&nbsp;Reviewed by <a href=#>Francesca Shillcock</a>, Senior Writer</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=69e3f159e0a5-underbelly-boulevard>Be dazzled at Underbelly Boulevard Theatre</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/69e3f159e0a5-underbelly-boulevard.jpg><p>London, listen up - there’s a hot new theatre on the scene!

As someone who is already quite superstitious, I was really excited when this opportunity presented itself. I opted for the 2024 Forecast Reading, which helped me discover what the next 12 months could look like while my tarot reader helped me understand what themes and guidance awaits. This was not about prediction, but rather ensuring I get the most out of the next 12 months.</p><p>My medium, called Rosie, greeted me with a warm smile, immediately putting me at ease. The atmosphere was calm and charged as the cards were shuffled and laid out. Each card seemed to hold a story, a narrative waiting to be unveiled. Rosie skillfully guided me through the cards and what they could mean, painting a vivid picture of my potential future.</p><p>What struck me most about the experience was the reader's intuitive ability to connect the cards to my personal journey. The interpretations were not only insightful but also somewhat accurate. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience and cannot wait to see what 2024 will bring. &nbsp;</p><p>The &nbsp;Wellness Foundry offers four different healing modalities: Crystal Healing, Reiki Healing, Spiritual Energy Healing and Sound Baths along with Tarot reading and angel reading.</p><p>Reviewed by&nbsp;<a href=#>Sharnaz Shahid</a>, Deputy Online Editor</p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=efe40a754d21-swingers-crazy-gold-restaurant-london>Eat, drink and be merry at Swingers West End</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/efe40a754d21-swingers-crazy-gold-restaurant-london.jpg><p>Every Sunday this month, London's popular crazy golf venue, <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://swingers.club/uk&source=gmail&ust=1702728791858000&usg=AOvVaw3upDBP3mPG-AXKtspmWqwR" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Swingers</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>West End, is offering a fabulous Festive Set for revellers to enjoy.

And in December, I had even more reason to visit as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>La Gamba</strong></a> is offering a special festive menu that showcases the best of the Spanish restaurant's menu.</p><p>Firstly, the menu is priced at £42pp, which is actually quite reasonable these days for London, especially given the amount of food you get. The normal a la carte menu is very extensive, so my friend and I were happy to just go for the Christmas deal as it took the thinking away for us and is designed for two people to share. It showcases the best of the Galician-inspired restaurant and dishes come out as and when they're ready.</p><p>Tapas are the order of the day and a highlight for me was definitely the croqueta platter which had jamon, crab and mushroom croquetas. If you're a sucker for croquetas, you'll love this. The succulent rib-eye with chimichurri sauce was also another stand-out dish, as were the mussels with chorizo. There was actually too much food that we couldn't finish it all, so it was just as well that the dessert was a small portion. We opted for the burnt Basque cheesecake which was served as one slice and was divine, but you could also go for the torija, which is a Spanish-style French toast.</p><p>All in all, a great-value meal and the setting is just totally buzzy and lively.

Feeling like I was somewhere between an American diner and a business lunch, this place was unique and buzzing.</p><p dir=ltr>It wasn't just the décor of course - which indulged in fusion. As the name suggests, this is a spot where sweet and savoury come to clash. Is it brunch, lunch, or dinner? I’m not too sure but the flavours just work together.</p><p dir=ltr>Of course I had to go for the signature dish (surprise, the ‘Duck & Waffle’ itself) which was mind blowing and creative. For a cute date spot, or for anyone with a bit of a sweet tooth I highly recommend checking out Duck & Waffle.</p><p>Reviewed by Elliot Newlands, Creative Video Lead<br></p><h2 class=GallerylistItemTitle_g1fw8d2g aria-describedby=23665252bfd8-sumosan-twiga-restaurant-london>Dine and Dance at Sumosan Twiga</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/23665252bfd8-sumosan-twiga-restaurant-london.jpg><p>One of London's most exclusive dining spots, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sumosan Twiga</a>, is great to visit all year round, but especially so at Christmas time when it's adorned with festive decorations. Having recently renovated the interiors of the restaurant and bar, with features like geometric black and white tiled floor made from Italian marble, and plush velvet furnishings throughout, the Knightsbridge venue is a hotspot you don't want to miss.&nbsp;</p><p>Fusing delicious Japanese and Italian cuisine together under one roof, the menu offers a wide selection of dishes, from sushi and sashimi to traditional a la carte options. We particularly liked the angus tenderloin, kobe sliders and wasabi prawns which were bursting with flavour. The ambiance whilst we dined was also top-notch; the venue has a weekly programme of entertainment including live bands and DJs, and on the Friday night that we visited, the restaurant was full of music and buzz.</p><p>One floor above the restaurant is Sumosan Twiga's bar, which is perfect for drinks and light nibbles, whilst downstairs you'll find a club where you can dance the night away. So whatever is on your agenda, you're guaranteed to have a good time!</p><p>To book, visit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>twigaworld.com</strong></a></p><p>Reviewed by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Arianna Chatzidakis</a>, Creative Content Director</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfqb%2BiwsSlZm5oaG1%2FeHvBnqqtZZOdv6q%2F06aYrGWknbavs9Jmq6hllKR6qrqMpaannJ%2BjeqWxwp6km52iYn9xfpJo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-christmas-things-to-do-in-london-december-2023.html&text=Magical%20things%20to%20do%20in%20London%20in%20December%202023%3a%20Festive%20markets%2c%20Christmas%20activites%2c%20more&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-christmas-things-to-do-in-london-december-2023.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-christmas-things-to-do-in-london-december-2023.html&title=Magical%20things%20to%20do%20in%20London%20in%20December%202023%3a%20Festive%20markets%2c%20Christmas%20activites%2c%20more" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-christmas-things-to-do-in-london-december-2023.html&title=Magical%20things%20to%20do%20in%20London%20in%20December%202023%3a%20Festive%20markets%2c%20Christmas%20activites%2c%20more" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-christmas-things-to-do-in-london-december-2023.html&title=Magical%20things%20to%20do%20in%20London%20in%20December%202023%3a%20Festive%20markets%2c%20Christmas%20activites%2c%20more" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-christmas-things-to-do-in-london-december-2023.html&description=Magical%20things%20to%20do%20in%20London%20in%20December%202023%3a%20Festive%20markets%2c%20Christmas%20activites%2c%20more" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./today-savannah-guthrie-speaks-out-honest-confession-relationship-co-star-off-air.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Savannah Guthrie speaks out with honest confession about relationship with co-star away from show">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./retro-fashion-trends-1149491.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to Style Each Decade's Hottest Looks in 2020">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
