In 2022, Anderson and Blanchard obtained a marriage license in Chillicothe, Missouri. It wouldn’t last, however, because People discovered the couple split on March 28, 2024. Here’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">why Gypsy Rose Blanchard and her husband Ryan Anderson split</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=why-did-gypsy-rose-blanchard-and-her-husband-ryan-anderson-split>Why did Gypsy Rose Blanchard and her husband Ryan Anderson split?</h2><p>A very subtle detail in Gypsy Rose’s divorce <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>post hints that the couple grew apart</a>. “People have been asking what is going on in my life. Unfortunately, my husband and I are going through a separation and I moved in with my parents home down the bayou,” she wrote in a statement obtained by People from her private Facebook account. “I have the support of my family and friends to help guide me through this. I am learning to listen to my heart. Right now <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>I need time to let myself find</a>… who I am.”</p><p>On April 3, TMZ reported sources close to the couple knew exactly why the couple split. “Gypsy has been telling family and friends that her estranged hubby,&nbsp;Ryan Anderson, had become super argumentative post-prison release and was constantly making her feel like she couldn’t do anything right,” the tabloid said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/where-gypsy-rose-blanchard-now.jpg><p>“We’re told one of the major sticking points in Gypsy and Ryan’s relationship was his apparent jealousy over her spending time with her dad,” they continued.</p><p>Other sources told the gossip site that “she wasn’t<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.tmz.com/2024/04/16/gypsy-rose-blanchard-and-ryan-anderson-blow-up-fight-food-hoarding/ rel=nofollow> fully aware </a>of Ryan’s hoarding issues regarding food before moving in with him after her&nbsp;release from prison. We’re told this caused tension for the couple in the 2-bedroom apartment they shared.”</p><p>Gypsy was allegedly bothered by Ryan’s fridge “as it was filled with a bunch of old food items that needed to be thrown away — and when he wasn’t home, that’s exactly what Gypsy did.”</p><p>Ryan went home and sources alleged that that sparked a huge argument, which left Gypsy feeling shaken and she found it scary he got so worked up about a fridge.</p><p>Anderson broke his silence on a newly made TikTok page. “Hey everybody, I just want to say thank y’all for the support and the nice messages I’ve been getting from people,” he took a video of himself on his&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>TikTok</a> on April 5. “I’m at a friend’s watching&nbsp;WrestleMania&nbsp;right now, it’s great. I’m enjoying it. I’ve been a wrestling nerd for a long time.” He looked at his selfie mode, “I need to shave. I’m just living my life, guys.”</p><p>In an interview with People in December 2023, Blanchard said she planned to marry the Louisiana middle school special education teacher again after her release so they could enjoy festivities with their loved ones.</p><p>“We do plan on having a reception/redo wedding with all of our family and our friends and the dress and the cake and everything because we deserve that. I deserve that. He deserves that,” she said. “Our prison wedding was just something to where we can make our vows to each other. It was something that meant something to us. And I think the party is kind of for everybody else and us, but mostly for everybody else.”</p><p>They did plan to have kids one day but telling them about her mother’s murder will be a challenge. “We’re in love,” says Gypsy. But also, “It’s hard because I’m going into a new life and I’m newly married, and I’m going to have kids one day, and I’m going to have to explain to my kids why their grandmother on mommy’s side isn’t around. And that’s going to be a really hard conversation.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=how-did-gypsy-rose-blanchard-meet-her-husband>How did Gypsy Rose Blanchard meet her husband?</h2><p>Blanchard’s husband sent her a letter in 2020, thanks in part to a co-worker. It was right at the beginning of the COVID pandemic and after watching&nbsp;Tiger King, his co-worker told Anderson she wanted to write to Joe Exotic. “I said, ‘I’ll tell you what, if you write him, I’ll write <a href=# id=auto-tag_gypsy-rose-blanchard data-tag=gypsy-rose-blanchard>Gypsy Rose Blanchard</a>,’” Anderson explained to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>People ahead of Blanchard’s release</a>.</p><p>“And I had watched her documentary&nbsp;Mommy Dead and Dearest, like three years before that. And then&nbsp;The Act&nbsp;had came out and I’ve never watched&nbsp;The Act, but I remember my friends talking about&nbsp;The Act&nbsp;and I was like, I’ll watch the documentary again. So it was kind of fresh on my mind.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gypsy-rose-blanchard.jpg><p>He said that he never expected to hear back from her, but by May 2020, they were regularly corresponding. A year after they started talking, they met for the first time. “We met in 2020 when the pandemic was really, really strong, and I had a lot of emotional ups and downs because of COVID,” Blanchard told People. “Unfortunately, it put the prison in a position to where it&nbsp;<a href=#>restricted our freedom even more</a>&nbsp;… So Ryan has seen me through some really good times, some really hard times.”</p><p>She added, “I would say that he is probably the most compassionate soul that I’ve ever met, and the most patient, God knows, he’s so patient with me because I could be a little bit of a lot to handle. I could be a handful, an emotional handful.”</p><p>Anderson and Blanchard obtained a marriage license in Chillicothe, Missouri, on June 27, 2022. A month later, on July 21, 2022, the two tied the knot in a small prison ceremony with no guests.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9lm1sbWhiZMSpxYygsKmrqWK%2FsL%2FEZpmlmZ6YtaK%2Bw2apspmeYq6vsMSrqqimXai9rbXTaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-gypsy-rose-blanchard-ryan-anderson-split.html&text=Why%20Did%20Gypsy%20Rose%20Blanchard%2c%20Husband%20Ryan%20Anderson%20Split%3f%20Divorce%20Reason&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-gypsy-rose-blanchard-ryan-anderson-split.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-gypsy-rose-blanchard-ryan-anderson-split.html&title=Why%20Did%20Gypsy%20Rose%20Blanchard%2c%20Husband%20Ryan%20Anderson%20Split%3f%20Divorce%20Reason" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-gypsy-rose-blanchard-ryan-anderson-split.html&title=Why%20Did%20Gypsy%20Rose%20Blanchard%2c%20Husband%20Ryan%20Anderson%20Split%3f%20Divorce%20Reason" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-gypsy-rose-blanchard-ryan-anderson-split.html&title=Why%20Did%20Gypsy%20Rose%20Blanchard%2c%20Husband%20Ryan%20Anderson%20Split%3f%20Divorce%20Reason" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-gypsy-rose-blanchard-ryan-anderson-split.html&description=Why%20Did%20Gypsy%20Rose%20Blanchard%2c%20Husband%20Ryan%20Anderson%20Split%3f%20Divorce%20Reason" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./victims-family-lawsuit-gilbert-goons-arizona-video-assault-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Street gang terrorizing sleepy Arizona town dubbed the 'Gilbert Goons' are sued by lawyer of victim ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./6542a2b246163f92878b4580-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Liga MX 2023: Tijuana vs Tigres dnde ver: a qu hora juegan y pronstico partido Xolos Liga MX h">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
