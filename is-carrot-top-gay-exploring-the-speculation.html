Over the years, fans have asked: is Carrot Top gay, and is he a member of the LGBTQ+ community?&nbsp;We explored the speculation.</strong></p><p>Carrot Top is one of the top comedians in the entertainment industry. Amid the laughter he brings to audiences, questions about his sexual orientation have been raised. Here, we shed light on Carrot Top’s private world and the truth behind the rumors surrounding his sexuality.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Carrot_Top></span>Who Is Carrot Top?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Scott Thompson, known professionally as Carrot Top, is an American stand-up comedian and actor. He was born February 25, 1965, in Rockledge, Florida, and grew up in Cocoa. He also attended Cocoa High School, where he played drums in the marching and concert band and graduated in 1983.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Crarot-top-819x1024.jpg><p>Thompson was nicknamed “Carrot Top” by a local swimming coach, referencing his red hair, which would become one of his trademarks in life. After high school, he enrolled at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton. While he was a freshman there, Thompson appeared in his first stand-up comedy routine.</p><p>His first “big break” was as a replacement act for Sam Kinison after Kinison died in a car accident in 1992.&nbsp;Over the years, Thompson has made many appearances, such as animations, internet series, and even live TV shows.</p><p>Carrot Top features in movies such as “Larry the Cable Guy,” “Christmas Spectacular,” “Space Ghost,” “Coast to Coast,” “Criss Angel,” “Mindfreak,” “<a href=#>Scrubs</a>,” and “George Lopez,” to name a few. He has also headlined a couple of comedy shows.</p><p>He is famous for his prop methods and has earned a name for himself in the Las Vegas comedy scene. Apart from Carrot Top’s TV and stand-up comedy appearances, the comedian has had a residency comedy show at the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas since 2005.</p><p>In 2019, he signed a contract extension granting him residency through 2025. The “King of Props” is estimated to have a net worth of about $80 million!&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Carrot_Top_a_Man_or_Woman></span>Is Carrot Top a Man or Woman?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carrot Top is a man. Although his over-the-top dressing, costumes, and mannerisms have caused fans to wonder if he is a male or female, the comedian has always identified as a male.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Carrot_Top_Gay></span>Is Carrot Top Gay?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>No, he is not gay. For years, fans have speculated the actor is a member of the LGBTQ+ community. Some say he is gay, and some say he is bisexual, but we assure you that he is not. He identifies as a straight male.&nbsp;</p><p>Thompson’s appearance has changed drastically over the past several years. After several rumored surgeries and facelifts, he has looked more feminine than masculine. This is why fans have speculated that he is gay, but the comedian has always denied this.&nbsp;</p><p>He claims he has never had plastic surgery, even if many do not believe him. After being asked this question in his interviews, he took it very coolly. His reply to all those questions was makeup made him look young, not surgeries.&nbsp;</p><p>In an <a href=#>interview</a> with Las Vegas magazine, he said:</p><p>“People say, ‘Carrot Top is gay’ or ‘Carrot Top got a facelift.’ Would I look better with a facelift? Or ‘Carrot Top does drugs.’ It’s so absurd and people say to me, ‘That hurts your feelings, right?’ Some of it does. But I’m a big fan of self-deprecating humor; that’s my whole thing.”</p><p>Similarly, the comedian’s notoriously private love life and the fact that he has remained unmarried even at his age have made fans inclined toward him being homosexual.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Carrot_Tops_Girlfriend></span>Who Is Carrot Top’s Girlfriend?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Many are unaware that Thompson has been in a relationship over the years as he keeps his personal life private. He is currently with his long-time girlfriend, Amanda Hogan, who he has been with since 2013. However, his dating history before Hogan is not known.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/carrot-amanda.jpg><p>Carrot Top’s girlfriend, Amanda Hogan, is a business owner born in August 1983. The two allegedly met in Las Vegas, where her company is based. She founded a catering and event-planning company called “Any Thyme Catering” in February 2012. Hogan also has a pottery and handmade tableware shop via Etsy, where she creates and designs handmade ceramics.&nbsp;</p><p>Hogan’s Instagram handle @<a href=#>anythymecatering</a>, initially a personal page, has been dedicated to showcasing her catering business since 2019.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Amy-catering.jpg><p>Since she was born in 1983 and Carrot Top was born in 1965, the couple has an 18-year age difference. Hogan still lives in Las Vegas, working on her catering, events planning, and pottery businesses.</p><p>Carrot Top and his girlfriend seem happy in their few public Instagram posts over the years.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktrR5wpqpq6ekYsGwvIygmLJlla29rbvRoqWgZaSdsm6%2Fz56arqSRqbawuo4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-carrot-top-gay-exploring-the-speculation.html&text=Is%20Carrot%20Top%20Gay%3f%20Exploring%20the%20Speculation&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-carrot-top-gay-exploring-the-speculation.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-carrot-top-gay-exploring-the-speculation.html&title=Is%20Carrot%20Top%20Gay%3f%20Exploring%20the%20Speculation" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-carrot-top-gay-exploring-the-speculation.html&title=Is%20Carrot%20Top%20Gay%3f%20Exploring%20the%20Speculation" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-carrot-top-gay-exploring-the-speculation.html&title=Is%20Carrot%20Top%20Gay%3f%20Exploring%20the%20Speculation" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-carrot-top-gay-exploring-the-speculation.html&description=Is%20Carrot%20Top%20Gay%3f%20Exploring%20the%20Speculation" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lexie-spiranacs-sister-is-reportedly-jealous-of-her-heres-why.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lexie Spiranacs Sister Is Reportedly Jealous of Her: Heres Why">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./inside-secret-radio-city-apartment-untouched-1936-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Inside secret Radio City apartment untouched since 1936">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
