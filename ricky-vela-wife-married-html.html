His heart was full of love for Suzette, but he could not bring the courage to express his feelings towards someone he could have called his wife in the future. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Even Suzette's family knew about Ricky's hidden feelings for Suzette, but everyone waited for Ricky to step up and express his feelings.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Abraham Quintanilla, Suzette, and Selena's father, also<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> acknowledged Vela's feelings</a> for his daughter and pushed him to step up.&nbsp;</p><p>"Ricky is a shy person, an introvert. And he liked my other daughter, Suzette, the drummer...And I know Ricky liked her because he would tell me, and I would kid around with Ricky and say, ‘Hey, Ricky, you like her? Talk to her!’ and he wouldn’t do it"</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>While everyone around him supported him, Vela did not confess his love for Suzette, which unfortunately led his love story to end without a proper start.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the unexpressed love story, Ricky, who could have married Suzette and made her his wife became just a dream as Suzette married&nbsp;Billy Arriaga in September 1993.&nbsp;</p><p>He then&nbsp;wrote,&nbsp;"No Me Queda Más,"&nbsp;(There's Nothing Left for Me) for his crush Suzette, which went on to become a smash hit of that time (1994).&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"No Me Queda Más," praised by music critics for its dynamic nature, was one of the most successful singles of Selena's career, which lifted Ricky's career as well.</p><p>After his heartbreak, Vela faced yet another unfortunate event that deeply impacted the band that he was part of.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Peek into the Love Story:-&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Jelly Roll Proving Critics Wrong with His Intriguing Love Story</a></strong></p><h2>What Happened to the Band?&nbsp;</h2><p>Two years after departing from his crush, Ricky was traumatized yet again in the year 1995 after the news of Selena's untimely death came to light. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Selena's death also became the main reason why&nbsp;Selena y Los Dinos disbanded, and Vela did not move on to join another band in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Although he was still involved in the music industry, he did not release any albums.&nbsp;</p><p>However, being a musician, he did not back away from music and was involved in the industry.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Another Musician:-&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow><strong>Willy Chirino’s Socials Screams Love for His Family</strong></a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Even after Vela's crush got married and the band he was part o got disbanded, he still had a good relationship with the Quintella family.&nbsp;</p><p>Ricky collaborated with Selena's brother A.B. Quintella, and the two together&nbsp;wrote the song "Esperandote." The song was a big hit and was also able to make a good run on the Latin music charts.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Also, it seems that Suzetta and Vela still have a good relationship with each other as the two were seen at the Billboard Latin Music Awards in 2015 and Suzetta even uploaded a picture with Vela in the frame.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><img alt="Ricky Vela and Suzetta in the Same Frame" height=570 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com//uploads/images/Ricky-Vela-suzette-.jpg width=592 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Ricky Vela and Suzetta alongside others at the&nbsp;Billboard Latin Music Awards (Source-<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Instagram</a>)&nbsp;</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-636 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Recently A.B. uploaded a picture of Selena y Los Dinos's poster and mentioned that he had dinner with his sister and Vela. His caption read,&nbsp;</p><p>Had dinner with my sister and Ricky Vela and I have to say they are the most talented musicians I’ve ever worked with!!!</p><p>This clearly shows that everything is going well between the duo, who could have been husband and wife if things turned out differently.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunC8jqugnKOpYsOmuMBmrqKelWK6or7RopydZpipuq0%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fricky-vela-wife-married-html.html&text=Ricky%20Vela%20Failed%20to%20Confess%20His%20Love%20Towards%20His%20Potential%20Wife%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fricky-vela-wife-married-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fricky-vela-wife-married-html.html&title=Ricky%20Vela%20Failed%20to%20Confess%20His%20Love%20Towards%20His%20Potential%20Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fricky-vela-wife-married-html.html&title=Ricky%20Vela%20Failed%20to%20Confess%20His%20Love%20Towards%20His%20Potential%20Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fricky-vela-wife-married-html.html&title=Ricky%20Vela%20Failed%20to%20Confess%20His%20Love%20Towards%20His%20Potential%20Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fricky-vela-wife-married-html.html&description=Ricky%20Vela%20Failed%20to%20Confess%20His%20Love%20Towards%20His%20Potential%20Wife%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-50-sexiest-fictional-male-characters.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 50 Sexiest Fictional Male Characters Ever">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./former-iowa-hawkeye-current-nashville-label-signed-country-singer-to-perform-in-muscatine.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Former Iowa Hawkeye, current Nashville label signed country singer to perform in Muscatine">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
