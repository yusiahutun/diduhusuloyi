I have absolutely loved the freedom of choosing how we spend our days, the fact I was a parent in the era, and I feel grateful I was able to be with them for those gorgeous, funny early years.</p><p id=eg1QQEHPJ8j data-wc=49>But there was a part of me that felt lacking. I found myself always trying not to answer, &nbsp;"Just' a mum", to the question, "And what do you do?". The knowledge that my children were about to start full-time school was there, nudging me to do something more, too.</p><p id=eivePGof8Hy data-wc=46>I was doing occasional freelance writing jobs here and there, but I didn't have the drive to pitch, pitch, pitch like the career requires. I waited for the work to come to me so, unsurprisingly, it was infrequent and, unsurprisingly, I was only earning pocket money.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c031523fc0db-sarah-clark-pink.jpg><p id=eg9xgpEC1jE data-wc=49>So, when my friends asked me to be a celebrant at their wedding, I jumped at the opportunity to do them a favour – and I had SO much fun, from planning to writing to delivering the ceremony. It actually ended up being life-changing (not to sound too dramatic).</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">What is a celebrant-led wedding ceremony?</h3><p id=ekMz9iuJ3p>“Having a celebrant-led ceremony offers couples so much freedom that they wouldn’t necessarily get in a traditional ceremony,"&nbsp;says wedding expert and editor of wedding planning website <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Hitched</a>, Zoe Burke.</p><p id=eTQ5BQnFbOB>"There’s room for personal stories, inclusive language, and cultural diversity, and couples also get to spend quality time with their celebrant beforehand to make sure that the ceremony truly reflects their unique relationship."</p><p id=ebtnZ1_p6wl><a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopenernofollow nofollow">Celebrant Sarah Clarke</a> adds: "The main difference [between a celebrant-led ceremony and a traditional one] is that we don't have to follow a set script or adhere to any rules, religious or civil. I meet each couple, get to know them and find out how they want their wedding to be.</p><p id=edJI5Q8oWwF>"There's a gorgeous freedom to taking a good look at a traditional wedding and then deciding what to keep, what to switch and what to add, depending on your personality, your beliefs, your sense of humour.</p><p id=eNFEHCmpO8f>"There's also the benefit of practical advantages - I ask my couples what they'd like me to wear so I don't clash with the often carefully-curated aesthetic, and I only book one wedding a day so that I don't need to be strict with time-keeping, as might be the case in registry offices and religious venues."</p><p id=e7nqiMsA5Xl data-wc=36>Ahead of my first time as a celebrant, stepping out of my comfort zone was worrying. I was nervous - it felt such a huge honour that anybody would put their wedding ceremony in your hands.</p><p id=eQLuwJHheoJ data-wc=13><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I overhauled my entire life on a whim – here's what happened</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e4uxmD5D57b data-wc=66>In the half-hour leading up to the ceremony, you would have found me loitering near the chilled sandwich fridges in the cafe next to the venue trying to cool my nerves (it didn't help that it was a London heatwave day!). But ultimately, that first day felt like I was stepping into something, rather than out; stepping into a role that just felt perfect for me.</p><p id=eWnV5EdqbHo data-wc=26>I decided - right then and there, on the veranda after the ceremony, Prosecco in hand, that I wanted to do this fun, joyful thing full-time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5f26077c24d9-credit-ellie-louise-photography.jpg><p id=ei1YlU48pAH data-wc=41>I suddenly felt like the things I loved - writing with a purpose, meeting people, hearing meet-cute love stories - had come together in one incredible job.
