Uma Thurman revealed to The New York Times years later, she told Tarantino she was worried about the car before the crash, but the director persuaded to carry on with the scene.

None of us ever considered it a stunt. It was just driving. Maybe we should have, but we didn’t.”</p><p>After driving it down the road to check it was all clear, he thought everything would be fine and told her she could ‘totally do this’.</p><p>He <a href=# rel=nofollow>added</a> to Deadline: “I came in there all happy telling her she could totally do it, it was a straight line, you will have no problem.</p><p>“Uma’s response was ‘OK’. Because she believed me. Because she trusted me… I told her it would be safe. And it wasn’t. I was wrong.</p><p>“I didn’t force her into the car. She got into the car because she trusted me. And she believed me”.</p><p>He asked Uma Thurman to drive the car down the same road but in the opposite direction for the better lighting, but had no idea it would crash. Quentin explained he didn’t think “there was any difference, going in the opposite direction”.</p><p>He continued: “Again, that is one of the biggest regrets of my life. As a director, you learn things, and sometimes you learn them through horrendous mistakes.</p><p>“That was one of my most horrendous mistakes, that I didn’t take the time to run the road, one more time, just to see what I would see”.</p><p>The Tinsel Town director said it affected them ‘for the next two or three years’, and ‘trust was broken’.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-justice-will-never-be-possible>‘Justice will never be possible’</h2><p>Uma shared the footage after Tarantino found it for her, with Thurman telling fans he was remorseful about the car crash.</p><p>She wrote at the time: “<a href=#>Quentin Tarantino</a> was deeply regretful and remains remorseful about this sorry event, and gave me the footage years later so I could expose it and let it see the light of day, regardless of it most likely being an event for which justice will never be possible.</p><p>“He also did so with full knowledge it could cause him personal harm, and I am proud of him for doing the right thing and for his courage.”</p><p>The pair not only worked together on the Silver Screen, but they became a <a href=#>celebrity couple</a> too. She was his ‘muse’ for many flicks, and worked together on Pulp Fiction as well as the Kill Bill movies. In 2014, they were romantically linked, but never confirmed they were dating themselves, keeping it on the down-low.</p><p>They reportedly broke up after some time, but it’s not confirmed when.</p><p>The footage can be seen below, but viewers are advised over its nature, which may be distressing to some.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2eGcMHMmmStoKWnuqK6jJucoqaXYsCmvsiorKykqWK2r7bUq5ydZZmjeqSt0Waaq5mjnXqwuoysnK1lp5bAbq2MoaarqpWjsbDB0makoquklrimew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fuma-thurman-being-seriously-injured-in-car-crash-on-set-was-a-horrendous-mistake.html&text=Uma%20Thurman%20being%20seriously%20injured%20in%20car%20crash%20on%20set%20was%20a%20%27horrendous%20mistake%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fuma-thurman-being-seriously-injured-in-car-crash-on-set-was-a-horrendous-mistake.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fuma-thurman-being-seriously-injured-in-car-crash-on-set-was-a-horrendous-mistake.html&title=Uma%20Thurman%20being%20seriously%20injured%20in%20car%20crash%20on%20set%20was%20a%20%27horrendous%20mistake%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fuma-thurman-being-seriously-injured-in-car-crash-on-set-was-a-horrendous-mistake.html&title=Uma%20Thurman%20being%20seriously%20injured%20in%20car%20crash%20on%20set%20was%20a%20%27horrendous%20mistake%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fuma-thurman-being-seriously-injured-in-car-crash-on-set-was-a-horrendous-mistake.html&title=Uma%20Thurman%20being%20seriously%20injured%20in%20car%20crash%20on%20set%20was%20a%20%27horrendous%20mistake%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fuma-thurman-being-seriously-injured-in-car-crash-on-set-was-a-horrendous-mistake.html&description=Uma%20Thurman%20being%20seriously%20injured%20in%20car%20crash%20on%20set%20was%20a%20%27horrendous%20mistake%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./vestidos-de-novia-bonitos-alta-costura-mejor-inspiracion-todas-edades.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vestidos de novia bonitos inspirados en la Alta Costura">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sarah-michelle-gellar-celebrates-milestone-age-defying-post.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sarah Michelle Gellar stuns fans with age-defying photo as she celebrates big milestone">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
