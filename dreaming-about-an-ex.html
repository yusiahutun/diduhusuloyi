JENN,</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I'm in a new relationship and am truly happy. I rarely think about my ex anymore and honestly feel like I've moved past the relationship. The thing that is throwing me off, though, is that she keeps showing up in my dreams. Sometimes it's sexual, but most of the time it's not. I keep waking up feeling really guilty and confused ... does this mean on a deeper level I'm not really over her? —&nbsp;The Ex Files</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>DEAR EX FILES,</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You are not alone. Dreaming about an ex is incredibly common — and no, it doesn't necessarily mean you have a deep-rooted&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>desire to get back together</a>, nor does it mean that you are dissatisfied with your current partner. Dreams and the unconscious mind are far more complicated than that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Still, it can be unnerving to not know why your former flame is making an appearance. Here are a few common reasons why you might be dreaming about your ex — and how to work through each scenario.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-1-you-are-mourning-the-loss-of-the-relationship></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>1. You are mourning the loss of the relationship.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even when a breakup is a good thing, we have to grieve the loss of the relationship and the person in our life. What does not get worked out during our waking hours gets worked through while we sleep. You may even dream about your ex dying, not because you want her to, but because you are mourning the 'death' of that relationship. This is a healthy part of letting go.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2-you-are-working-through-a-past-trauma></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2. You are working through a past trauma.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Our unconscious mind is always trying to work through unresolved issues, whether they're from childhood, previous relationships, or some other trauma we've experienced. If there's an unresolved issue in your life, it's likely to follow you from relationship to relationship. For example, if your first love betrayed you, you may&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>dream about cheating</a>&nbsp;on your new love with your ex to work through your trust issues. In other words, your ex may simply be a stand-in to help your unconscious work through the larger roadblock.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-3-you-are-integrating-previous-relationship-lessons></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>3. You are integrating previous relationship lessons.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The more distance we get from a breakup, the more awareness we tend to have. That means it's not uncommon to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>process a breakup in stages</a> — even long after you think you've "moved on." Sometimes, dreaming about someone you once loved is a way of helping you take the lessons you learned in the previous relationship into your new one. Consider it a gift — and a sign that you're evolving and growing.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-4-your-ex-represents-something-else-significant></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>4. Your ex represents something else significant.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In dreams, people, places, and things are often symbolic. Your ex may symbolize a time in your life or something else important. A good question to ask yourself:&nbsp;What feelings or memories does the person make you connect with when you analyze the dream?&nbsp;This can provide a roadmap for you to better understand what your ex is representing. It can also help you work through and process whatever you need to deal with (that probably has nothing to do with your ex).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-5-you-need-closure></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>5. You need closure.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sometimes, we dream about an ex because we don't feel at peace with how things ended. Whether you wanted out of the relationship or not, breakups often don't go as planned. Maybe you wish you said something differently or that you behaved differently. Maybe something your ex said upset you and stayed with you, but before you text your ex to get "closure," know this: We don't need to actually speak to an ex in order to get what we need to feel resolved with the end of a relationship. Sometimes, a dream is a way of working towards that closure on our own.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-6-you-have-unmet-needs-in-your-current-relationship></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>6. You have unmet needs in your current relationship.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even if you are happy with your new love, it's normal for there to be some things you wish were different in the relationship. Maybe there is something that your ex did that you wish your current partner was providing, emotionally or sexually. In this case, the dream might help shine a light on an unmet need so you can talk it out with your current partner. (And no, you don't need to share that you had a dream about your ex to do that.)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-7-you-are-just-not-over-your-ex></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>7. You are just not over your ex.</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In my clinical experience, this is the least likely scenario. Usually, when someone is not over their ex, they know it and are talking about it in their waking hours. On occasion, there are situations where someone is just very out of touch with their emotional process and is not over their ex, and it shows up in their dreams. If this is the case, you have some soul-searching to do. It's important to look at why the relationship ended, what did not work for both people, and to figure out if it is something you really want. Keep in mind that people often idealize a relationship once it is over or feel lonely and desperate to get back with someone that is familiar.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-decode-your-dreams></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Decode Your Dreams</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Our unconscious mind tends to code things in our dreams so they aren't startling enough to wake us up. However, they can provide enough information to help us to process the difficult things we need to work through. This is applicable even when your dream is not about someone you once dated. Any time you have a dream you are looking to decipher, ask yourself a few questions to get to the bottom of what it's&nbsp;really&nbsp;about.</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><li>What do you feel in the dream?</li><li>Is this an old feeling or a new feeling? If it is old, when do you first remember feeling it?</li><li>What might this person, place, or thing represent from your past?</li><li>If any&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>numbers are mentioned</a>&nbsp;in your dream, what do you associate those numbers with?</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-final-thoughts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Final Thoughts</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Our dreams are a pathway to our unconscious mind. If your dreams are on your mind or concerning you, you may want to consider keeping a dream journal so you can look at patterns, themes, feelings, and issues that come up repeatedly. This can help you use your dreams to work through the things on your mind — whether that's your ex or not.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In Hump Day, award-winning psychotherapist and TV host&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Jenn Mann</a>&nbsp;answers your sex and relationship questions — unjudged and unfiltered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8OrnJqlmaO0bq3BqKytZZGjeqbE</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdreaming-about-an-ex.html&text=What%20Does%20It%20Mean%20When%20You%20Dream%20About%20Your%20Ex%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdreaming-about-an-ex.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdreaming-about-an-ex.html&title=What%20Does%20It%20Mean%20When%20You%20Dream%20About%20Your%20Ex%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdreaming-about-an-ex.html&title=What%20Does%20It%20Mean%20When%20You%20Dream%20About%20Your%20Ex%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdreaming-about-an-ex.html&title=What%20Does%20It%20Mean%20When%20You%20Dream%20About%20Your%20Ex%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdreaming-about-an-ex.html&description=What%20Does%20It%20Mean%20When%20You%20Dream%20About%20Your%20Ex%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./44-facts-about-the-movie-live-flesh.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="44 Facts about the movie Live Flesh">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./knots-landing-cast-recalls-being-like-family-on-shows-set.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Knots Landing Cast Recalls Being Like Family on Set of the TV Classic: We All Had Fun">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
