You may famously know her from the infamous reality show she appeared in along with her sisters and other family members at the age of 9 called “ Keeping Up With The Kardashians”. At the age of 21, she became a self-made billionaire. This reality star started a makeup line called Kylie Cosmetics and a skincare brand called Kylie Skin that grew to be worth $900 million today, according to Forbes. Her journey from being under her sister’s shadows to becoming a makeup mogul is definitely interesting. However, people took more interest in her life when at the age of 20 years she announced her first pregnancy. Although weight loss after pregnancy at a younger age is much easier, it still takes time, effort, and determination, which Kylie exhibited right from day one. Her journey is awe-inspiring and relatable to many. As she grew in front of the camera while on the show, people speculated that she underwent several plastic surgeries which is the reason for her face transformation. Nonetheless, she never went on record to address these claims.</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h2><strong>What is the Kylie Jenner workout routine?</strong></h2><p>Kylie Jenner was not known to be a fitness freak before her pregnancy. She reportedly enjoyed working out with her sisters Chloe and Kourtney. She mentioned one particular amusing incident where the three sisters went to work out with Don, their personal trainer. He had prepared a workout session with four different quarters, but Kylie just finished her first and prepared to go home as she was not “feeling it!”. However, things do change after pregnancy and her look out towards a strict workout regime did too. She is now known to follow a rigorous workout routine that she performs five to six times a week religiously. She particularly enjoys high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts as these allow for frequent changes in actions, unlike other repetitive and boring workouts.&nbsp;</p><p>She also mentioned how regular exercise not only helped her physically but also mentally. Being a new mother sure takes a toll on an individual’s mental health and Kylie Jenner was very vocal about the changes that she faced. Moreover, exercising has been scientifically proven to enhance your overall health and feelings of well-being, providing an extra boost of energy in your daily life. Furthermore, exercise directly contributes to reducing stress by stimulating the release of endorphins, the brain's feel-good neurotransmitters <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Kylie Jenner’s Workout Routine That Made Her Body Fit And Fabulous","1233763","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6091217/#:~:text=Elevated%20serum%20beta%2Dendorphin%20concentrations,responses%20of%20numerous%20hormones%20(growth","articlepage","/health/fitness/kylie-jenners-workout-routine-1233763","(1)","Body_Hyperlink","health","fitness")'><u>(1)</u></a>.</p><p>Although we do not have the exact day-to-day workout routine she follows, we did gather resources that gave us an overview of the most frequent and important ones in her routine.

Her meals are usually divided into 5-6 small portions throughout the day. She advises to not follow any fad diets as anything that claims to offer quick results will not help you to maintain a long-lasting healthy lifestyle. Therefore, she carefully chooses what to eat and usually loves home-cooked meals and stays away from junk food, to maintain her current body. To observe faster results, pair a nutritious diet mostly containing organic foods with a devoted workout routine. However, she also agrees that adding some yummy, wholesome foods into your diet every once in a while in the form of a few cheat meals in moderation will not harm your results, rather it will keep your weight loss journey exciting.</p><p>Below given is a diet that is similar to Kylie Jenner’s diet plan that you may follow daily:</p><ul><li>Before Breakfast: Celery juice</li><li>Breakfast: Seasoned eggs, smashed avocado and bacon</li><li>Lunch: Organic pressed juice and kale salad with chicken or tacos and guacamole</li><li>Snack: Detox tea</li><li>Dinner: Chicken, prawns, or fish with vegetables and rice or rocket pasta or sushi</li></ul><p>Kylie Jenner is lactose intolerant so she avoids dairy products completely. However, if you want, you can add healthy dairy options like cheddar cheese, greek yogurt, cottage cheese, and more to your diet. To know if you are lactose intolerant too, check if you feel bloated or have digestive issues after consuming dairy products, or confirm with your healthcare provider if you are lactose intolerant. If you test positive, it is advisable to replace all dairy products with vegan alternatives like almond milk, peanut yogurt, etc. <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Kylie Jenner’s Workout Routine That Made Her Body Fit And Fabulous","1233763","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4586575/","articlepage","/health/fitness/kylie-jenners-workout-routine-1233763","(2)","Body_Hyperlink","health","fitness")'><u>(2)</u></a>.</p><h2><strong>Other Health Mantras That Kylie Jenner Follows</strong></h2><p>Kylie Jenner follows certain fitness mantras that have helped her both physically and mentally.
