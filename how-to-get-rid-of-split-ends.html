Well, whoever came up with that line clearly wasn't paying attention to their hair. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Split ends</a> are an ironclad fact of life and a truly great equalizer of humankind. Everyone's bound to get them, no matter your hair texture, color, or length, says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Annagjid "Kee" Taylor</a>, celebrity hairstylist and mastermind behind some of Keke Palmer and Tiffany Haddish's best hairstyles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, since the whole split ends problem affects nearly everyone on the planet, there's an avalanche of nourishing and reparative hair care products available to ensure tresses stay healthy from root to ends — for as long as possible. Here, we consulted with a trio of experts to find out about their favorite treatments and to see what tips they could offer up to keep breakage at bay.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep scrolling for expert-approved ways to get rid of split ends in no time.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-split-ends></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What are split ends?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When your hair becomes more prone to tangles, feels dry and coarse, and/or hair is breaking, chances are, you're dealing with split ends. "As your hair grows out, the further from your scalp the older the hair is. And as your hair ages, it is more prone to breaking, fraying, and unraveling," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Gregga Prothero</a>, master stylist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Gregga LA</a>. "Think of that old iPhone charger as it gets used, you’ll notice the outer plastic may separate and unravel. Your hair behaves the exact same way. That is a split end."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-prevent-split-ends></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How do you prevent split ends?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While there aren't a ton of ways to get rid of split ends once you have them, there are a lot of expert-approved methods to prevent them from happening in the first place. According to Taylor, "If you're not taking care of your hair, your ends will split a lot faster." So following the proper hair care regimen is key. Here's how:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Switch up your routine for the season.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Where you live plays a huge role in the type of hair care products to use — and they should all be rotated out seasonally. Winter's dry, cold air is notoriously harsh, especially on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>natural hair</a>. "Lean into your natural texture and wear <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>styles that are more protective</a>," suggests <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Larry Sims</a>, the hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Gabrielle Union-Wade</a> and Regina King have on speed dial. Summer sun can also do some damage since the sun and heat strip hair, adds Taylor. To combat the inevitable lack of moisture during both summer and winter, load up on formulas with a cocktail of extra-hydrating ingredients, like honey, rich oils, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>hyaluronic acid</a>, to keep strands resilient and strong. For fall and spring, focus on restoring and strengthening damaged and weakened hair.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Choose hydrating hair products.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"One of the major causes of split ends is dryness," Prothero tells us. "As our hair gets longer, the natural oils from our scalp don’t always distribute to the ends. So make sure to condition your ends with a hydrating conditioner." Other products in her repertoire for preventing split ends? Davines's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Nourishing Keratin Sealer</a> and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Melu Hair Shield</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Be careful with wet hair.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong><span class=ql-cursor></span></strong>"Another major cause [of split ends] is just plain old direct damage.&nbsp;You can prevent a lot of the wear and tear on hair by just being gentle with it," says Prothero. "This means not roughing up the hair by rubbing vigorously with a towel especially when it’s wet. This can damage hair cuticles causing frizz and more split ends. Instead, she recommends using a microfiber towel to blot or gently scrunch wet hair. "One thing about the hair, is it's weaker when it's wet, so you want to make sure that when you're handling wet hair, you're being as gentle as possible, no matter the hair type," adds Taylor. She swears by always using a wide-tooth comb, and never a paddle brush to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>detangle</a>, working from the ends up.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Use a hair mask on the regular.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Sims, integrating a deep conditioning mask into your regular wash day routine is crucial for all hair types, but especially for those with naturally curly and coily hair. "Curlier hair tends to be drier in general because of the make-up of the hair strand and cuticle," says Sims, who always reaches for the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Flawless by Gabrielle Union Repairing Deep Conditioning Masque</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Cool it with the hot tools.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In news that should shock no one, both Taylor and Sims are passionate about putting down the hot tools. "Excessive amounts of heat from blow dryers, flat irons, curling irons will cause ends to split faster," says Sims. Instead, he says to try <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>air drying</a> if you can. Taylor recommends that people with natural curls only use heat once every six months and those with straight hair, once a month.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Opt for a light hot oil treatment.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>thin or fine hair</a>, try a light <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>hot oil treatment</a> once a week to seal moisture into the cuticle. "It rinses off not totally squeaky clean, but light enough so that fine hair doesn't feel weighed down and you still get all the nutrients and the moisture," says Sims. And speaking of oils, coating the ends of dry or wet hair with an intensely hydrating oil, like almond, argan, or jojoba will soothe and smooth out hair, while also protecting against further damage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Even though oils can't reverse an already split end, it will help seal the [healthy] hair and keep it nourished all the way down to the end," says Taylor. Just keep in mind that oils are potent, so start small with a pea-sized amount and apply it just to the ends, especially when using it on dry hair.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Use a leave-in.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Who doesn't love some good set-it-and-forget-it action? To get your day started, liberally spritz a moisturizing leave-in conditioner on your ends. And make sure it's packed with protective powerhouse ingredients, like proteins, fatty omegas, and oils, which you can all find in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Playa's Monoi Milk</a>. "Leave-ins are lightweight and super moisturizing," says Sims. "They're great for people who want to do blowouts, and it's also great for people that rock their hair curly and natural, kind of like wash-and-go type of girls." For oil-prone hair types, apply from mid-shaft to ends and avoid the roots to avoid a greasy-looking finish.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Choose strengthening ingredients (and treatments).</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Strong hair is way less prone to breakage, and ingredients like biotin and creatine will help to build strength, says Sims. A super restorative treatment, like cult-favorite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Olaplex</a>, won't hurt either. "Our hair is basically made of a protein: keratin," explains Sims. "You really want to make sure that you're using protein-building products to essentially saturate the hair cuticle, rebuild it, and restrengthen it so that you are less likely to have those same sorts of hiccups in terms of split ends."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Rethink your wash day routine.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One of the most simple and efficient hacks to boost hydration and absorption is to shampoo and condition your hair as soon as you step into the shower. Then let the conditioner sit while you wash your body and do your thing." I'll wash my hair, condition it, leave the conditioner sitting while I wash up and then I rinse it out," says Taylor. To really maximize shower time, Taylor suggests popping a plastic shower cap over conditioned hair for the rest of your shower to activate the conditioner even more.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-get-rid-of-split-ends></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Get Rid of Split Ends</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've invested in a healthy hair care routine, you're already 10 steps ahead in preventing split ends. However, as hair grows and ages, it will eventually split, which is why it's important to get regular trims (read: every three months). "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The main way to truly get rid of ends is to get a haircut," says Prothero.
