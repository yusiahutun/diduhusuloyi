Actress Amanda Plummer is active as ever in her life, and when several of her counterparts are proud mothers of several children, Amanda seems least bothered about getting married. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Amanda Plummer: Never been Married; No Children!</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Still very active in her performances in theatres, Amanda has apparently no time for settling down. Currently, at 59 years of age, she still has the motivation as well as energy to go along and work out on tight schedules, under pressure and challenges.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Although she has played in plenty of movies and shows, it is hard to imagine that she hasn;t found the right one for herself. Amanda is not the easiest person to along with, and the proof for that is her lack of relationships in these many years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>So far as we know, Amanda has only had a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">couple of boyfriends</a>, and neither of those relationships led anywhere serious. She was first believed to have dated actor Peter O'Toole, after the two of them worked together in a couple of movies as well as shared stage.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>However, the relationship was very lowly maintained, and the media were not aware of it untile rumors of their breakup came out. Her second partner was another actor named Paul Chart, and the two of them were seen together on several occasions.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Despite some hoax about their possibility of getting married, that didn't happen. Instead, they got separated and since then, Amanda has not been linked with anybody else. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>As she has never had any husband and never been married herself, there is no question that she hasn't had any children in her life, nor has she adopted any. It is often said that Amanda never really found out anybody who could be her husband, although she hasn;t said so, but that still seems to be the case.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Also, she is not sexually gay and has not portrayed any lesbian roles as far as we know. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>About Amanda's Biography:</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Amanda Plummer is an American actress who was born on the 23rd of March, 1957 in New York City of United States. She was born in a family of actors, and it is not surprising that she turned out to become one.</p><p style=text-align:justify>She was the only child of actors Christopher Plummer and Tammy Grimes and her family ancestry consists of former prime minister of Canada; John Joseph Caldwell Abbott.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Although Amanda was intended to become a jockey as a child because of her fascination towards horses, she later thought about working out as an actor; inspired by the success and lifestyle of her own parents. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Having appeared in over a hundred different TV shows and movies, she is best known for her work on stage and has appeared in plenty of theatre acts; both Broadway and off-Broadway.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Her Broadway debut came in 1981 in A Taste of Honey, although she had been acting on stage for a long time before that. It was in the early 80s that she established herself as a professional actress, and also started to appear in TV shows as well as movies.</p><p style=text-align:justify>With her long and successful career, some of the highlights would be when she won awards like Tony Awards, Boston Critics Circle Awards, and Emmy Awards as well.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>With her net worth value of 2 million US dollars, she was last seen in early 2016 and has two movies coming out soon; Honeyglue and The Dancer.&nbsp;</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Caption: Amanda Plummer wins 1982 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play</strong> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Source: awardscrazy</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZpqbpKeytL%2BMmqSappSWerG41Kaknqpdo7K3sdFmmZ6dnmK6or7RopydZZOdtq2w0Z6lZpyZmbtuwIyfoKecXaWys7LEnKtmoKWor6K6w2efraWc</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2factress-amanda-plummer-never-been-married-children-didn-t-find-perfect-husband-html.html&text=Actress%20Amanda%20Plummer%3a%20Never%20Been%20Married%2c%20No%20Children%2c%20Didn%27t%20Find%20Her%20Perfect%20Husband%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2factress-amanda-plummer-never-been-married-children-didn-t-find-perfect-husband-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2factress-amanda-plummer-never-been-married-children-didn-t-find-perfect-husband-html.html&title=Actress%20Amanda%20Plummer%3a%20Never%20Been%20Married%2c%20No%20Children%2c%20Didn%27t%20Find%20Her%20Perfect%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2factress-amanda-plummer-never-been-married-children-didn-t-find-perfect-husband-html.html&title=Actress%20Amanda%20Plummer%3a%20Never%20Been%20Married%2c%20No%20Children%2c%20Didn%27t%20Find%20Her%20Perfect%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2factress-amanda-plummer-never-been-married-children-didn-t-find-perfect-husband-html.html&title=Actress%20Amanda%20Plummer%3a%20Never%20Been%20Married%2c%20No%20Children%2c%20Didn%27t%20Find%20Her%20Perfect%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2factress-amanda-plummer-never-been-married-children-didn-t-find-perfect-husband-html.html&description=Actress%20Amanda%20Plummer%3a%20Never%20Been%20Married%2c%20No%20Children%2c%20Didn%27t%20Find%20Her%20Perfect%20Husband%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./joel-michael-singer.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Joel Michael Singer Biography, Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sanderson-sisters-then-and-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Sanderson Sisters from 'Hocus Pocus' Then and Now">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
