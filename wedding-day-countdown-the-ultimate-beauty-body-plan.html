With my&nbsp;date just a week before my 36th birthday, I knew that it would take discipline and dedication–lets be honest, with age, simply opting for salads at lunch and slathering on a moisturizing face mask weekly isn't going to cut it. If I wanted a sleek silhouette, including the elevated booty and Madonna-like arms that would so elegantly complement my beloved <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://kennethpool.com/bridal/#celia data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action='Kenneth Pool&nbsp;"Celia" gown' class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Kenneth Pool&nbsp;"Celia" gown</a>, &nbsp;I was going to have to work for it. If I wanted to turn back the clock on sun damage, enlarged pores and those expression lines on my forehead, I was going to have to be diligent with my at-home and in-office treatments. After a few months of albeit, intense workouts, super clean eating and consistent beauty appointments, I was not only 15 pounds lighter, I was more toned all over.&nbsp;I&nbsp;had legit curves. My skin was glowing and smooth. When I slipped on my dress that day&nbsp;and looked at my reflection, I felt transformed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I will preface the month-by-month plan below,&nbsp;that potentially could be deemed extreme by some,&nbsp;with this: I am a beauty girl. I write about breakthroughs, innovations, treatments, and products in beauty and fitness for a living. It's in my blood,&nbsp;and I know as much as anyone the power that they can have not only physically but mentally–I was willing to do it all.&nbsp;What you feel when you see yourself in the mirror is more than skin deep. Bottom line: do what you need to do to be your best self. I promise, your hard work and the cost will be worth it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Countdown: 5 Months</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I knew it was time to start perfecting my skin. Especially because my main complexion concerns, although not severe (i.e. subtle sun damage all over and enlarged pores as well as just obtaining an inherent glow), would require repetitive treatments to see stellar results. I made an appointment with my amazing dermatologist, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.beautyrx.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr. Neal Schultz" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr. Neal Schultz</a>, who recommended getting his signature 40 percent glycolic peel on my face, chest and hands ever two weeks and applying his <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.beautyrx.com/spf50-sunscreen data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SPF50 sunscreen" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">SPF50 sunscreen</a> daily under my makeup to ward off future damage. I immediately penciled the biweekly sessions into my iCalendar to slough away dead skin, keep my pores clear and help erase dark spots over time. Regardless of what else I had going on, I made time to pop over to his office on Park Avenue or his <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.beautyrx.com/the-peel-bar data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Beauty Rx Peel Bar" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Beauty Rx Peel Bar</a> outpost at the Flatiron Butterfly Salon for a quickie two-minute (with zero redness) session. Not only did my stress-induced breakouts stop, but also after a few weeks, I could see that my skin was looking more radiant.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While living by the beach for the summer at my New Jersey home, I knew I had to jumpstart my fitness routine and lay the foundation for a slimmed down physique worthy of my wow-factor dress. I started off with personal training sessions with local fitness expert, Mark Hibbard, founder of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.nextlevel-fit.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Next Level Fitness" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Next Level Fitness</a>. I showed him a picture of my dress. so that he could not only tailor my workouts to hit my trouble spots (the usual female-focused suspects such as toning up my triceps, flattening the lower area of my belly and strengthening and tightening up my legs) but also focus on&nbsp;what made sense for my dress. Not only were my arms exposed, the plunging illusion neckline and open back as well as the form-fitting backside meant that I had to look lean from every angle. For the next two months, I showed up with my hair slicked back ready to work for 60 minutes, three times a week, regardless if I was tired, hung over or too busy. Each time, we would start with a dynamic warm-up (think high knees and walking lunges), then alternate days of cardio bursts and strengthening–all with my beloved Celia as the main get-fit goal.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Countdown: 4 Months</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now that I had the dress, I also knew how I did—and did not—want to wear my hair. I envisioned long blonde hair side swept over my right shoulder in cascading finger waves. Which meant, I needed to grow my hair as long as possible so that I didn't lose length from pulling it all to one side.&nbsp;I booked an appointment with Bumble&Bumble hair stylist <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.bumbleandbumble.com/index.tmpl data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Denise McLaughlin" data-vars-ga-product-id=3782310f-bf79-4834-858e-af67d70c47e4 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=http://www.bumbleandbumble.com/index.tmpl data-product-url=http://www.bumbleandbumble.com/index.tmpl data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bumbleandbumble.com%2Findex.tmpl" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=2ad5f12e-1221-4c48-b136-2d35e098583a class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Denise McLaughlin</a>&nbsp;in the Meatpacking district to explain my vision and a showed her a picture of the stunning exposed and lace-lined back of my dress that simply could not be hidden behind my hair. She put me on a 8-10 week strict trim protocol to snip off dead ends and prevent breakage, which would allow my hair to grow and still look super healthy.&nbsp;</p><img alt="Shoulder, Joint, Back, Beauty, Neck, Embellishment, Bridal accessory, Lace, Wedding dress, Blond, " title="Shoulder, Joint, Back, Beauty, Neck, Embellishment, Bridal accessory, Lace, Wedding dress, Blond, " width=2296 height=3450 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/06/1455054632-hbz-nicole-wedding-01.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Herr</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My three times a week sweat sessions with Mark continued. A month into it, instead of being able to only execute five perfect pushups, I could do ten while he added a resistance band around my waist as well. In lieu of the regular calve raises I started out doing, he would have me hold a ten pound weight now, and chest press with 25 instead of 15 pound dumbbells. I steered clear of the scale, opting to judge my results by how easily my pants zipped up and how much faster I could get through his relentless cardio blasts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Countdown: 3 Months</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I have been a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.barrysbootcamp.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Barry's Bootcamp" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Barry's Bootcamp</a>-er for a few years, however my attendance has ebbed and flowed. I am well aware of the body benefits of HIIT training and Barry's does not disappoint. Now that I was back in the city full time, I began booking the 60-minute cardio and strength training class three times a week to replace my personal trainer one-on-ones and kept that up all of the following month as well. After that, I&nbsp;increased sessions to 4-5&nbsp;times per week&nbsp;in the final month leading up to my wedding day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As a beauty and health writer, I have heard over and over from experts that when it comes to losing excess fat, we truly are what we eat. So as much as you try to hit the gym or bike for 60 minutes a few times a week, workouts alone cannot reverse the effects of a poor (read: carb, calorie and sugar laden diet). With 90 days to go, I knew that I could not start an extreme clean diet just yet, as that wasn't entirely sustainable, but I began to make smart and doable tweaks. First, swapping out carbs in the a.m. for protein (a plain Greek yogurt with sliced banana, an&nbsp;omelet with veggies or a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://juicegeneration.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Juice Generation" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Juice Generation</a> Peanut Butter Split smoothie)&nbsp;as well as cutting alcohol intake down to three days a week. At my first fitting, while I still knew I had more to do, I went Spanx free and visually honed in on where I needed to step it up (belly and arms!).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Countdown: 2 Months</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To me, along with the dress, my hair and skin were two crucial components to completing my look. Sure, makeup was essential, but it would come naturally if my skin was gorgeous. Since my hair&nbsp;was not going to be&nbsp;down and flowing, it needed to be in amazing shape. Just like my figure, they too were on full display. I wanted my hair color to be just right: bright blonde and not at all brassy. I booked an appointment with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://arrojonyc.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Arrojo class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Arrojo</a> colorist Taylor Kline&nbsp;who&nbsp;painted on a head full of highlights, then whipped up a slightly deeper shade to paint over the darker pieces, and then finished with a toner. Suddenly, my tired blonde was Kate Hudson vibrant. She told me to use a purple conditioner 1-2 times a week (like my favorite <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/ttps://www.net-a-porter.com/us/en/product/514422 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Christophe Robin hair mask" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Christophe Robin hair mask</a> for Baby Blonde hair) and&nbsp;to come in for a mini-touch up two weeks before.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While my&nbsp;lioness-like&nbsp;hair is not only long but also thick and full, my nails are in a constant state of carnage, breaking below my skin line before they even have a chance to grow. To make my tips photo-op ready, I hit the drugstore for over-the-counter <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=320703&catid=308207&aid=338666&aparam=320703&kpid=320703&CAWELAID=120142990000069033&CAGPSPN=pla" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=One-A-Day class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">One-A-Day</a> prenatal vitamins.&nbsp;I popped one every a.m. and threw a few in my bag to have on the go.

I explained that I wanted eyelash extensions instead of wearing glued on falsies because everyone claims you need the length for your eyes to stand out in pictures, but I wasn't a fan of the fake effect. Brow expert, Sabah Feroz, told me lay down in the reclining chair and close my eyes. An hour later, I fluttered my eyes open to&nbsp;super fine lashes that were not only longer, fuller and perfectly graduated, but&nbsp;created&nbsp;a natural uptick at the corners and were&nbsp;completely undetectable.</p><img alt="Clothing, Coat, Dress, Trousers, Human body, Bridal veil, Photograph, Standing, Suit, Outerwear, " title="Clothing, Coat, Dress, Trousers, Human body, Bridal veil, Photograph, Standing, Suit, Outerwear, " width=2296 height=3450 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/06/1455057066-hbz-nicole-wedding-02.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Herr</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Countdown: 1 Month</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With the number of my face-neck-hands glycolic peels now in the double digits, I pointed to the two lines on my forehead and between my brows that were there even when my face was at rest.

But even&nbsp;slathering on SPF 50 like it was my job could not stop&nbsp;a weekend in Florida from&nbsp;taking&nbsp;my skin into a tailspin, initiating a never-before-seen case of melasma. I panicked. All those months of skin appointments for nothing! A friend pointed me in the direction of a light therapy called <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.gerstnermd.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Clear+Brilliant class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Clear+Brilliant</a> with her Gervaise Gerstner, MD.&nbsp;I made sure to alternate sessions with my glycolic peels to give my skin time to recover. After one pass of a heated red light on my skin and an icepack for about five minutes, I left the office only slightly pink. Within three hours post-treatment, there wasn't a trace of red. And a few days later, I saw that the large brown circles on each of my cheekbones were not&nbsp;quite as prominent, and&nbsp;I promptly&nbsp;booked follow-up sessions for the next two weeks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At this point,&nbsp;I can totally see my body transforming. The muscle tone in my arms, belly and legs is more defined&nbsp;and I can power through workouts and try&nbsp;the more difficult versions of the&nbsp;moves as well. I continue my six days a week sweat sessions, calling on fit friends to join me as many times as possible to keep me focused and motivated.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Countdown: 2 Weeks</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This week is all about maintenance. I head uptown for my&nbsp;second to last glycolic peel with Dr. Schultz. Later&nbsp;in the week, I&nbsp;stopped&nbsp;in to see Dr. Gervaise&nbsp;who suggests we do a second Clear+Brilliant treatment,&nbsp;but this time to lessen pore size not target pigment&nbsp;which uses a different level of light and heat and won't be too much on my skin. I am getting complements on how my complexion looks with zero makeup on (I wore NONE the last two weeks to keep pores completely clear), and with my daily workouts consuming my days&nbsp;(alternating between Barry's Bootcamp and SLT classes) and natural glow, I didn't even need tinted moisturizer or blush.&nbsp;At Arrojo salon in TriBeCa, I get a quick color touchup to remove the brassiness that has inevitably built up in the last few weeks, and Taylor brings my blonde back to the perfect shade.&nbsp;</p><img alt="Clothing, Floor, Dress, Flooring, Shoulder, Textile, Room, Bridal clothing, Formal wear, Interior design, " title="Clothing, Floor, Dress, Flooring, Shoulder, Textile, Room, Bridal clothing, Formal wear, Interior design, " width=2296 height=3450 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/06/1455057154-hbz-nicole-wedding-03.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Herr</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=57 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Countdown: 1 Week</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=59 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My main focus&nbsp;is keeping my skin in check. I inspect each&nbsp;pore every morning and night to make sure there's nothing brewing underneath the surface that may cause major issues the day-of. Dr. Schultz gives me one last peel trifecta as well as troubleshoots one potentially scary breakout that is forming on my upper right cheekbone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Gerstner insists that if she was me, she would absolutely do one last Clear+Brilliant to break down any remaining pigmentation near the surface. Since I had no adverse reaction the other two times, I too felt confident it would be safe&nbsp;to do one last one this&nbsp;close to my wedding day. At last–operation best skin of my life is complete!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=61 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As my mind raced through any potentially last minute disastrous occurrences, I thought of sweating. If my anxiety shot through the roof, my sweat glands could kick into overdrive. Having wet circles on my gown was a scary thought that I wasn't willing to risk. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.pfrankmd.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank&nbsp;" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;squeezed me in that same day and after numbing my underarms for about 20 minutes with a topical cream, he did a few quick injections all over the area. Sweat? What sweat?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=63 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With my honeymoon in St. Barths planned, I was finally&nbsp;getting to wear my hot, new,&nbsp;high-cut <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.barneys.com/Eres-Bandeau-One-Piece-503771820.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Eres class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Eres</a> suit.&nbsp;I booked a Brazilian Bikini wax at the downtown <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://havenspa.nyc data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Haven Spa" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Haven Spa</a>,&nbsp;my go to because of their no nonsense yet comforting demeanor during &nbsp;an otherwise excruciating experience.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=65 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Everyone had told me that the week leading up to the wedding was when I would see the payoff of all my hard work. While this was toally true, I knew that I still wanted to stick to my get-fit plan and not veer off until I was sitting poolside in St. Barths. Continuing to nix alcohol, sugar, and simple carbs, I ordered five days of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://sakara.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sakara Life" data-vars-ga-product-id=7ddaa850-00b6-4b95-b897-ad23a8aaa612 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=http://sakara.com data-product-url=http://sakara.com data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsakara.com" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=712a47a1-83fe-44a1-82c5-f3ceff176a41 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Sakara Life</a>, the celebrity and model favorite plant-based food delivery program that sends pre-made and perfectly packed meals that I could easily eat on the go and at home without stressing over how to cook or eat clean. Game. Changer. I felt lighter, less bloated and looked leaner. Taking food planning off my plate felt like a relief as I focused on the last minute check list: seating charts, table names, decorations and planning the rehearsal dinner.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=67 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong data-redactor-tag=strong data-verified=redactor>Countdown: 24 Hours</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=69 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On the morning of, I woke up at 6am from pure adrenaline and excitement (no alarm required). During hair and makeup,&nbsp;I couldn't even think of consuming one of the bagels from the huge breakfast display set up for my female entourage. But, I did know one thing:&nbsp;I was going to eat at the wedding. The mayhem and tight schedule of photos and the ceremony would be done soon enough, and my husband and I would &nbsp;be able to share our first meal together. I also couldn't wait to get my now married hands on a glass (or two or three!) of champagne. But, every time I sat down to chow down on the French roast cut chicken, potatoes and artisanal bread basket, we were surrounded by well wishers and loved ones. I&nbsp;wanted to take it all in;&nbsp;savor the moment, not the food. And so, starved at 1am and&nbsp;after stepping out of my beloved&nbsp;gown, I ran into the kitchen and boiled a huge pot of water.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sam and I each devoured a bowl of pasta and washed it down with a glass of Moet overlooking the ocean&nbsp;before heading to bed, full of love.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/917f25a9-2c14-4e6f-b975-33ac6bd2a265.jpg alt="Headshot of Nicole Catanese" title="Headshot of Nicole Catanese" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Nicole Catanese is a beauty and wellness editor.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfrLKlsMinnmiaop6xoriMm5yaraSufKJ9k2ppcWenmrGltc2gZJ2ZqWKwsMHNrZuor55iwamxjK6jraGdlsGmecGemK6sqWKvsLDYZqelmZ5k</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwedding-day-countdown-the-ultimate-beauty-body-plan.html&text=Wedding%20Day%20Countdown%3a%20The%20Ultimate%20Beauty%20%26amp%3b%20Body%20Plan&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwedding-day-countdown-the-ultimate-beauty-body-plan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwedding-day-countdown-the-ultimate-beauty-body-plan.html&title=Wedding%20Day%20Countdown%3a%20The%20Ultimate%20Beauty%20%26amp%3b%20Body%20Plan" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwedding-day-countdown-the-ultimate-beauty-body-plan.html&title=Wedding%20Day%20Countdown%3a%20The%20Ultimate%20Beauty%20%26amp%3b%20Body%20Plan" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwedding-day-countdown-the-ultimate-beauty-body-plan.html&title=Wedding%20Day%20Countdown%3a%20The%20Ultimate%20Beauty%20%26amp%3b%20Body%20Plan" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwedding-day-countdown-the-ultimate-beauty-body-plan.html&description=Wedding%20Day%20Countdown%3a%20The%20Ultimate%20Beauty%20%26amp%3b%20Body%20Plan" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mary-compton-obituary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mary Compton obituary | Trade unions">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-psychology-of-music.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The psychology of music">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
