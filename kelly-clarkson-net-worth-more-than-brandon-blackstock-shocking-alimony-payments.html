She won the first season of the show in 2002 and subsequently went on to release her chart-topping single 'A Moment Like This'. Aside from her discography, the country megastar has also appeared as a coach on The Voice and has hosted her own talk show called The Kelly Clarkson Show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/93cca9c26283-kelly-clarkson-performing-on-american-idol.jpg><p id=ebev0mXOzN data-wc=53>Meanwhile, in 2016, soprano singer Kelly dipped her toes into the world of publishing and signed an impressive book deal with HarperCollins. Her first children's book called River Rose and the Magical Lullaby was released in October 2016. She went on to release a second book called River Rose and the Magical Christmas.&nbsp;</p><h2>What is Kelly Clarkson's net worth? &nbsp;</h2><p id=eUbXtaq4EoGw data-wc=51>The singer and talk show host, 41, has an estimated net worth of<strong>&nbsp;$50 million</strong>, while her husband, a talent manager – and <a class=hm-link href=#>Reba McEntire's</a> former stepson – has a reported net worth of ten to twelve million.
