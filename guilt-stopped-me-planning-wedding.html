I was so looking forward to being a bride, so why have I dragged my feet when it comes to wedding planning?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6d193760ec6e-louise-engaged.jpg><p id=eG7Q6Crx2g1 data-wc=14>The answer is guilt, and it was robbing me of my joy. Let's rewind.</p><p id=eDq0x-tMe-v data-wc=39>Years back, I went to university and fell in love. Not long after, I was choosing a ring and wafting around wedding fayres feeling fizzy with anticipation for what would surely be the most perfect day of my life.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Why didn't anyone warn me how bad mum guilt would be?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f8c8d202c8cc-mum-guilt-2.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Why didn't anyone warn me how bad mum guilt would be?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Why didn't anyone warn me how bad mum guilt would be?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eFmxHoWLcja data-wc=25>What I wasn’t focussing on was the actual relationship. I decided every red flag was just jitters and every off week was a bad patch.</p><p id=eR7DVndpbZJ data-wc=75>The wedding rolled around and whilst there were lovely moments, there was a lot that I hadn’t planned well, hadn’t really understood or didn’t feel good about. This was a time before Pinterest and Instagram, I had <a class=hm-link href=#>no doting Mum to help me plan</a> (though I know she looked on from heaven) and I was only twenty-four. It was all too much, too soon and frankly, I didn’t do a very good job of things.</p><p id=emcy-2HxGDG data-wc=32>I was a young bride, three months pregnant, crying over minor letdowns which on the day felt major and more importantly, in a relationship that deep down, I wasn’t sure was right.</p><p id=e7Km6jcisBs data-wc=51>Important to note, I take full responsibility for my wedding disappointment and after that, things didn’t work out. Nobody did a classic ‘bad thing’, I just wasn’t the right fit. These are my very personal, one-sided feelings and an account of a time when I absolutely was not my best self.</p><p id=ePkhdxQehv data-wc=20>I had spent so long being dazzled by the idea of a wedding, I hadn’t considered the realities of marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/abaffc0983a4-louise-1.jpg><h3><strong>The divorce chapter</strong></h3><p id=eHwNMHZmBIZ data-wc=15>I thought divorce would be just like a big breakup, but I was so wrong.</p><p id=ecWwz6Vo2WP data-wc=46>Divorce, in my opinion, is a trauma category all its own. I learnt far more about myself through divorce than I did marriage, and not all of it I was prepared for. You see the depths of yourself in a divorce. The good, bad and ugly.</p><p id=emJ4QDEGYeu data-wc=31>Even though I felt right down to my core that it was the right choice for all of us in the long run, there were so many times I doubted myself.</p><p id=ejSI5_0MREs data-wc=12><strong>&nbsp;READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I went through a trainwreck divorce - here's what I learned</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=etS3VpPbfTn data-wc=52>It was a loneliness I hadn’t imagined and a slow but brutal heartbreak. I first grieved the end of a relationship (which surprised me, given I felt so strongly I shouldn’t be in a marriage) but what shook me most was that I found myself grieving my future and my daughter’s too.</p><p id=e5d5lIrG0B1 data-wc=42>I thought I had everything mapped out, but the rug was ripped out from under my feet – by me. I fretted about how my choices would affect my little girl and if I’m honest, I still worry how she's been impacted.</p><p id=e1OltuedUs data-wc=8><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>How I found myself again after divorce</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>Guilt around divorce</strong></h3><p id=eOTm4YTawe8d data-wc=69>The whole experience was horrible, and the guilt was suffocating. I was ashamed I hadn’t managed to make things work and I was embarrassed about what my wedding guests would say. I felt guilty that I hadn’t been the wife I had promised to be - ‘til death do us part’. I felt even more guilty that I hadn’t provided my daughter with the family unit she absolutely deserved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c72d62cbe0dd-louise-daughters.jpg><p id=eK1Ha7PNltaK data-wc=28>It was emotionally akin to holding my breath, jumping off a cliff, with my little girl in my arms as I plummeted and hoping the landing was alright.</p><p id=eqG8nCxFHIc2 data-wc=21>Thankfully, the jump turned out well and a decade later, I can look back from a more positive and compassionate place.</p><h3><strong>Falling in love again</strong></h3><p id=e6DBEXBSbXhG data-wc=21>A couple of years later, I met my Liam, which resulted in baby Pearlie and the fairy tale proposal I mentioned.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9c602e1ab7bd-louise-liam.jpg><p id=ePo3lCw2TbdX data-wc=48>But I just couldn't bring myself to plan my wedding. No part of me wanted to let myself enjoy wedding planning. I couldn’t cope with thinking of history repeating itself. I poured energy into making sure the relationship was good, with solid foundations and a strong family unit.</p><p id=eeabEL6LNyRO data-wc=65>Running out of excuses and reasons to delay, we decided 2025 would be a good year to say, ‘I do’ and I tentatively allowed myself to start planning. But guilt was holding me back. I was there physically but not mentally. It didn’t feel like my wedding at all. I kept saying, 'I’m excited to be married but I’m not too fussed about the wedding.'</p><p id=e1lpJmMBh2fN data-wc=15>But all that changed when a friend and I had a frank conversation about guilt.</p><p id=exwSAd2QhhIk data-wc=37>We talked about how we feel guilty for so much, big and small and how it’s the biggest waste of energy ever, which prompted the idea of guilt-free joy. Feeling joy, without letting guilt steal the shine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1aaeef759c12-louise-boat.jpg><p id=edAM9ka7S7Cs data-wc=15>Once you start letting guilt-free joy sink into your life, things start to radically change.</p><p id=ejwlSnDt_hQ3 data-wc=78>Guilt-free joy has been instrumental in kickstarting me into planning my wedding – finally! While viewing a potential wedding venue, I felt the old fears flood back like a wave taking over me. Negative talk and imposter syndrome filled my mind and I felt like I shouldn’t be there, talking through canapes and drinks receptions. Until I remembered, . Did I need to feel guilty this? No. Should I allow myself joy in my new marriage? Yes.</p><p id=e5v4gsSDBrIl data-wc=49>It was like a light clicked on and I was in control of my emotions again. I toured that venue imagining smiling at Liam, the girls nearby, the good energy of all our favourite people in one room, celebrating something so joyous. I nearly cried! I’d set myself free.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2188e3fea38e-louise-wedding-planning.jpg><p id=ei6cVlKLychW data-wc=46>I’ll be carrying my new mantra into March and letting you know exactly what it brings for me.
