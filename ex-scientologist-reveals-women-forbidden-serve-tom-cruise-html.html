Cringe-worthy YouTube clips have surfaced from the event showing Cruise, now 56, singing and dancing to the band, then proclaiming: 'This is incredible...

From the age of 15 to 25, for ten years we would write back and forth,' she says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>August marked the 12-year anniversary since Shelly was last seen in public.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Former church members have speculated that she has been at a secret Scientology base called Twin Peaks in the San Bernardino Mountains since 2006.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Valeska, however, has a different theory and doesn't believe Shelly is living in a 'Scientology prison' as others have suggested.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She's not there against her will, the treatment she'll be getting is a lot better than most would receive. She's living in the mountains and, yes, sure, she's under security watch and it won't be like before, as she was living like a queen,' she says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Yet, it's not like she'll be in RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force) conditions. Imagine his wife going into the RPF, she knows more than anyone about COB's secrets, he is going to have to keep her happy.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The church has long denied any rumors suggesting Shelly is missing and have insisted that she is devoting her time to the work of the Church of Scientology.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Valeska says she used to see Shelly on the ship when she came aboard for Maiden Voyage and the two kept in touch through written correspondence about their personal lives, including Valeska's first marriage.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Weddings were common among Sea Org members and most married as teens and twenty-somethings since sexual contact is not allowed before marriage.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'When I was on the ship, I married a guy called Roberto, I was only 20. Shelly was pleased, she told me: "Good, you have someone to look after you, I don't need to do it." She wanted to see all the photos from my wedding album,' she says.</p><img id=i-cdc75e13e1ec58fd src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/21/4F108AEF00000578-6156353-image-a-4_1536871116924.jpg height=792 width=634 alt="Valeska eventually fled the church after completing RPF (Rehabilitation Project Force) in Australia.

You can't criticize Scientology. All letters are read before they leave the ship.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I would always tell her good things after that first letter, we couldn't say anything negative. I would write to her about anything going on in my life.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She would always send me letters on her letterhead 'Michelle Diane Miscavige.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As a child, Shelly had encouraged Valeska to get an education, something that was not encouraged in Scientology, she claims.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'One day she drove me home in her car, she told me that her biggest regret was not getting an education, she had joined the Sea Org as one of founder L. Ron Hubbard's messengers at the age of nine and stopped going to school. She wanted me to do some schooling.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She personally ordered me a whole set of math tapes, and had me listen to them every day for a couple of hours. Every time I saw her, she would test me on my math, and would always ask me what I learned.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She ordered me to go to school and I went for a couple of hours a day, but that stopped after barely two months as Scientology had to pay for it, and that was considered too "expensive,"' Valeska alleges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'COB had also told me in an earlier conversation that school was a waste of time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Despite all she did, I left school at 14 with no grades, no education and no guardians as my father was in the Sea Org at Saint Hill and my mom had escaped the Sea Org with her new husband and I was left behind.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Valeska thinks Shelly doted on her because she didn't have her own children.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Shelly loved animals, she would go out every day at the Hacienda [Sea Org accommodation] and feed stray cats, she had real empathy and love for any animal, I think that's the maternal instinct.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'She seemed to really want kids, but didn't have any, and I was a child. She was really good with Jenna, Miscavige's niece, as well,' she adds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Valeska claims that problems with Shelly's began after the death of Scientologist Lisa McPherson in 1995.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The 35-year-old was reportedly denied medical treatment by the church after a car crash, and the Florida State medical examiner called it 'negligent homicide.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Church was indicted on two felony charges that were later were dropped after the state's medical examiner changed the cause of death from 'undetermined' to an 'accident.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A civil suit brought by her family against the Church was settled in 2004.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-19412da0618f60b6 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/21/500A9F2600000578-6156353-image-a-6_1536871127259.jpg height=528 width=634 alt="An email conversation between Valeska and her father Jean-Francois Paris, shows how leaving that church has forbidden her from speaking to her own dad&nbsp;&nbsp;" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>An email conversation between Valeska and her father Jean-Francois Paris, shows how leaving that church has forbidden her from speaking to her own dad&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The negative publicity rocked the church and Miscavige.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I would hear him scream at the top of his lungs while I was working in the kitchen next to the execs room, I would be shaking, it was so scary.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'When Lisa McPherson happened, he changed. All of the execs he was friends with, that all disappeared. His circle went even smaller,' she alleges.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Shelly's usually strong relationship with her husband began to falter - he dismissed the whole of his board of executives in favor of younger, more eager to please, dedicated Sea Org members, such as Lou Stuckenbrock, for whom he created the position 'COB Communicator'.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Shelly became more and more stressed out. COB would be in the dining room with his Communicator Lou and she would eat afterwards,' Valeska claims.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'In her letters she would never say anything, but she was writing less and less, I got the sense she was more stressed. She wasn't perfect, but she stood by COB for years, and I never saw them argue, but I always saw that he was very close with Lou.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'In 2005, he said in a meeting that Shelly had been taken "off his lines," but he wasn't going to divorce her, he was way too qualified to ever marry any other Sea Org member. She was extremely dedicated to him. His words were: "She messed up his communication lines."'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Shelly has since retreated from public life; once a prominent member of the church, she was even absent at Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes's wedding in 2006.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 2013, Hollywood actress and famous Church defector Leah Remini filed a missing person report with the Los Angeles Police Department for Shelly.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Police eventually said that they had interviewed Shelly and confirmed she wasn't being held against her will and didn't want to make any public statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Valeska's correspondence with Shelly came to a stop after she left.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She says her time at the church worsened in 2007, after she was sent to England 'on a mission' during Maiden Voyage.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Only days into it, Valeska got into hot water for daring to speak to a married man and she was ordered back to the Freewinds and sent to the engine room.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After all this treatment, Valeska was suicidal and desperate to get out.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'In my mind, I was either going to end it or get off that ship,' she adds.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But Valeska also had no skills for the real world, her brother Raphael, 36, and father Jean, 66, were and still are in the church today, she'd never be allowed to see them again if she absconded.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She'd also 'disconnected' from her mother Ariane and younger sister Melissa, 38, 14 years ago when they left the Church.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They wouldn't let me off this ship. I had served COB and knew their dirty little secrets. It was still hard to leave, I'd been in the Sea Org since 14, I had no education, no money, never had a bank account, I had no idea how to live in the real world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I'd lose my brother and father instantly, I didn't know if my mom or sister would reconnect or where they lived. I'd been indoctrinated that Scientology is life,' she says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Valeska was sent to the RPF in Australia, in the hope that it would 'rehabilitate' her.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>During this time, she met Chris Guider, a former rugby league legend in Australia who gave it all up in the 80s for Scientology.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'After graduating the RPF, they started making my life hell again. They were threatening to send me back to the ship, but I'd already decided I would never, ever go back to that place again,' she says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'When we finally got free, we had no one to judge us, I could watch TV when I wanted to, I had a normal room that wasn't a dormitory, I felt so much freedom. That's when I realized that Scientology was, in a nutshell, s**t.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I hadn't seen my mom and sister for ages. I hadn't seen my mom for so long that when I first saw her, I went up to the wrong person. We didn't recognize each other.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'My dad sent me a text saying he was going to disconnect from me for talking to my mom and sister, this was at the same time as I was eight months pregnant with my first child.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Today, Chris and Valeska now live happily in Brisbane and have three children - Declan, eight, Evan, six, Rhys, three - but still live under the shadow of Scientology's disconnection policy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Valeska said: 'I have three children who've never met their grandfather. I haven't spoken to my brother since 2010. My family is destroyed. But we got out and we're having a good life. Hopefully my dad and brother will wake up one day, and my door will always be open for them.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In a statement to DailyMail.com the church said: 'What has been said about us all too often—as is the case here—is pure propaganda. It is inaccurate and intentionally avoids showing who Scientologists really are and what we do.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Propagandists look to capitalize on the growing curiosity about Scientology. They have manufactured controversies where there are none while refusing to show the Church, its organizations, its humanitarian programs as well as its unprecedented growth in Churches worldwide.
