Even if there are some turbulent emotions, it's time to get out and enjoy yourself more with friends. Perhaps you'll meet some new people too which could be quite fun! You may also find a spark of romance in the air, which would be great news if you're looking for someone special. The Full Moon could also bring up some exciting creativity as you get more in touch with the world of the child. It's time to run out and about and have some fun! You could also have more to do with children, which will encourage your own childlike wonder and sense of playfulness.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium femail-ccox mol-style-bold">Taurus (April 20 to May 20)</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>&nbsp;Home is where the heart is, and your home and family are front and centre this month. You may also have old memories of your childhood coming back for attention so it would be a good idea to feel all the feelings around those old events. You are now an adult so do let go of childish notions and make a decision to move forward with confidence in yourself. You can now leave behind old dependencies and habits. Women could be more important to you than usual and a nurturing environment may also be very helpful to you. You could entertain friends or family in a warm and beautiful atmosphere.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium femail-ccox mol-style-bold">Gemini (May 21 to June 20)</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Your communications could be warm as you shine your light this month. It's a great time for promotion and marketing if you have a business or you're involved in these areas in your work. You're probably more inclined to make decisions based on your feelings and intuitions and that's ok. Don't forget though, logic is handy for some important considerations especially around your finances. It's also a great time to gallivant around your local area or chit chat to a neighbour over the back fence. Study could also be on your agenda and you will probably have some greatly incisive insights. New ideas abound!</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium femail-ccox mol-style-bold">Cancer (June 21 to July 22)</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Your focus could be drawn quite dramatically to your finances this month. You may also find that possessions with a sentimental value become more important and women could be implicated in some way. Financial links back to the past may also come up, or perhaps something happens with a treasured memento such as an old photo? There could be some unpredictable or strange elements so do watch for excessive impulsivity – looking before leaping is the keynote here. You could be also feeling a lot of warmth and affection for your loved ones who are likely to reciprocate in kind!</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium mol-style-bold femail-ccox">Leo (July 23 to August 22)</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This month is all about you as the Full Moon is in your sign! You are ruled by the Sun and it's a wonderful time to shine your light out into the world. Your identity and/or appearance could undergo changes now as you may seek to create greater alignment between your authentic self and how you are perceived by the world. You're likely to be quite sympathetic to others, however, don't forget to use your head for logical decision making. There's a tendency for you to get swept along with the feeling of the moment rather than looking at long term consequences. The Full Moon is opposite the Sun so you may be feeling at 'cross purposes' about something important.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium femail-ccox mol-style-bold">Virgo (August 23 to September 22)</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>You may feel more inclined to keep to yourself this month and this is a good thing! The Heavens suggest it's time for some self-reflection, meditation and going down deep within to become more emotionally aware. You may find emotions or turbulence coming up into your mind for healing and gentle release. Journaling is a good option here; write everything down and avoid judgements about your feelings which are just as equally valid as your thought processes. A peaceful natural environment can help you now. Avoid loud and discordant people or situations. It's a fabulous time for healing the past especially regarding intimate matters or shared assets.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium femail-ccox mol-style-bold">Libra (September 23 to October 22)</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It's a fabulous time for socialising, meeting new people or attending clubs and groups. The Full Moon helps you to stand out of the crowd and you could be feeling more affectionate and warmer than usual. Most people are likely to respond well to your luminous vibration! However, as you are quite sensitive, this also has a downside. If you do perchance feel ignored by someone, you will likely feel this quite intensely so stick to your knitting and focus on self-approval rather than seeking the approval of others. Overall, though, your social life should go quite well and it is time to spread your wings a little more than usual.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium femail-ccox mol-style-bold">Scorpio (October 23 to November 21)</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>You could be in the 'public eye' in some way this month and it's likely to go quite well for you! Your life likely becomes more public whether you want it to or not, so do be cautious of oversharing on social media. Career takes centre stage and you could find yourself warmly nurturing or taking care of someone else in the course of your work. You could also find your own sensitivity mirrored in those you take care of, allowing you to learn something about yourself. Delicate dealings with a parental figure are possible – if not an actual parent, someone who is an authoritative role model or leader in some way could be involved.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium femail-ccox mol-style-bold">Sagittarius (November 22 to December 21)</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>&nbsp;Travel could feature more for you now. You may be thinking about taking a trip somewhere and that's a good thing! You need some excitement and variety in your life and travel can help to bring back a spark into your life. Anything exotic or different will probably also appeal to you. There could also be more contact with other cultures, perhaps you meet new people from far off lands? Mix it up a bit and draw positive new experiences into your life. Study, spirituality or philosophy may also pique your interest now. You're probably inclined to be a bit emotionally restless, so step outside your comfort zone and taste the world!</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium femail-ccox mol-style-bold">Capricorn (December 22nd to January 19)</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>You may become aware of the ways that you close yourself off to others in an attempt to lessen the possibility of being emotionally hurt. It's almost as though scars from the past influence you to shut down intimacy or closeness with others who care about you. Despite this you probably do want an intimate life with someone special. If you can learn to treat each situation anew without being unduly influenced by your past, you can open the door of opportunity to emotional fulfilment. There could also be some financial ructions concerning shared resources with another, however Mars is smiling at you so you can probably chalk up a win here.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium mol-style-bold femail-ccox">Aquarius (January 20th to February 18)</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Your committed relationships and significant partnerships possibly could experience turbulence. The Full Moon in Leo is bringing up subconscious forces who wish to be 'the boss of the wash', either at home or in business. It's a time for clearheaded negotiation about who does what and how they do it. It's particularly important to you as your happiness and security are inextricably linked to your important relationships, even if these people are 'just friends'. Women could be involved in this process. Talk it out and try to resolve any differences in a peaceful manner, even if you feel like you are being pulled in multiple directions or there are mixed messages.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-medium femail-ccox mol-style-bold">Pisces (February 19 to March 20)</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Passionate emotions are at the forefront, but remember you are not a rehab centre – it is not your job to fix people! Say this as a mantra 10 times daily to get it into your head that people have their own lives to live. Having said this rather bluntly, your sympathetic nature is a beautiful example of what the world needs more of! However, it's a balancing act between what works best for you and them. Your daily life activities, habits, work and perhaps even your health could be affected. If you feel stressed because you're helping others and they don't seem to appreciate it, then you could be doing yourself a disservice! Stop it! Look after yourself and others in proportion.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Source: Rose Smith&nbsp;</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/femail/reallife/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>'They are known as fixed because the sign occurs in the middle of the season.
