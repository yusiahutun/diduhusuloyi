The first award show was held on May 4, 1959, at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, as well as the Park Sheraton Hotel in New York City. However, it wasn’t until later that year, at the second Grammy awards, that the show was televised for the first time. Its first live telecast was with the 13th <a href=# id=auto-tag_grammys data-tag=grammys>Grammys</a> in 1971.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>Since the <a href=# rel=noopener>Grammys</a> started more than 60 years ago, thousands of artists have received the coveted award: a gold-plated, gilded gramophone trophy made of zinc alloy. Though there are more than 80 categories across more than 25 fields and music genres, the Grammys are best known for their “General Field” categories (also known as the Big Four categories): Album of the Year; Record of the Year; Song of the Year; and Best New Artist. “Artists will often see a boost in album sales and streaming numbers after taking home a Grammy in what’s called a ‘Grammy bump,’ but the size of the bump often correlates with how many awards are collected and when in the ceremony the wins occur,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Billboard</a> reported in 2022 of the significant of the Grammys. “Generally, primetime award wins and showstopping performances during the main telecast will yield bigger gains.”</p><p>So…where can one stream the Grammys?

In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Las Vegas Magazine</a> before the 2022 Grammys, which were hosted in Las Vegas, Noah revealed how he thought the 2022 award show would be different from past ceremonies. “I can’t wait to share the electricity of the night with 15,000 people live. It’s going to be energizing and so insane. We’ve spent two years as a society kept away from each other, and as we move back to normal these types of moments are a great way to celebrate,” he said. He also discussed how Las Vegas, where the Grammys will film, will add to the Grammys telecast. “Vegas seems like the perfect fit for the Grammys. Everyone goes to Vegas to party and enjoy the best performers in the world, and now on one night everyone shares the same stage. It’s going to feel special,” he said.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Independent</a> before the Grammys 2023, Noah opened up about what it was like to host the Grammys for the third time. “The nerves come in because you’re standing in front of not just some of the best, but some of the biggest performers in the world,” he said. He continued, “Every year, I notice that I develop a different rapport with the people in the room. That opens you up to a few more jokes and a few more conversations in a way where people understand the context of who you are in relations to them. It means you get to have a little bit of fun without anybody feeling like you’re dunking on them.”</p><p>Noah also told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> in 2023 about what it was like to host the Grammys in 2022 after Will Smith’s slap at the Oscars 2022. “Neutralizing it wasn’t really my aim, if anything it was more acknowledging it. I think that’s what I enjoy doing in my comedy, and I’ll do the same thing at this show, as well as talk about what’s happening,” he said. “I talk about the performances as I see them, because I’m still also a fan. And so as much as I’m working with the Grammys and with the team, I’m still someone who’s absorbing this and who’s enjoying it. I always try and be as authentic as possible, as a bridge between the audience that’s watching the show and the show itself.”</p><p>Noah, who left as the host of The Daily Show in 2022, also told Variety about what it was like to host the Grammys without the stress of his Comedy Central talk show. “It’s going to be very different! I don’t know if I’m used to it yet — normally I’m thinking about, you know, going straight back to New York to make a show, thinking about the slides for it,” he said. “So I do enjoy having a little more time to prepare for the show and to just celebrate creating the show. I still think there is a magic in award shows that we can often take for granted because of how ubiquitous media has become. I don’t take it for granted — it’s a room of amazing people who are doing phenomenal things, and you can see in their eyes how much this means to people who maybe have dreamed of it for their entire lives.”</p><h2>Who are the Grammys 2023 performers?</h2><p>The Grammys 2023 performers at the main show include Harry Styles, Adele and Bad Bunny.
