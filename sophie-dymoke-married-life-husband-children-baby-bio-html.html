In September 2013, they made another addition to their family with a beautiful baby girl named Teddie Eleanor Rose Goode, and later in August 2015, the duo&nbsp;was&nbsp;blessed with a baby boy, namely Ralph Goode.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The couple has only been sighted together with their&nbsp;eldest daughter, Matilda Eve Goode, and son Ralph Goode. However, their daughter, Teddie Eleanor Rose Goode, is away from the limelight.&nbsp;Sophie Dymoke and Matthew Goode have remained cautious regarding their children's privacy. Their children rarely make public appearances&nbsp;and are also not actively seen on social media. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-192 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Don't Miss:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Is Kate Adie Married? Family Details & Personal Life Status Finally Revealed!</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Recalling how they first met, Sophie's husband shared&nbsp;in an interview with metro.co.uk&nbsp;in February 2010.&nbsp;Where he talked about the start of his relationship and what it led to. He reminisced about the events nostalgically, saying,</p><p style=text-align:justify>“I was living in Clapham and she was on my doorstep when I came home. Literally. I thought: ‘Fu***** hell!’ She was a friend of my neighbour."</p><p style=text-align:justify>He was also asked whether Sophie was ok with the explicit gay content that Goode had&nbsp;to take part in Watchmen, which he promptly responded with,</p><p style=text-align:justify>“No, she’s not, thankfully. She’s normal. Which is great. I don’t have to worry about her saying: ‘I’m just going off to do this film with Brad Pitt,’ and you read the script and it says: ‘She rides him frantically.’”</p><p style=text-align:justify>When he was asked about how the couple decided to have a baby before marriage, Goode said,</p><p style=text-align:justify>“Yes, mainly because I don’t have a pot to piss in at the moment and weddings can be quite expensive if you want to do it with all your mates rather than at your town hall.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>He further&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">went on</a>&nbsp;about how he prepared himself for playing as a dad,</p><p style=text-align:justify>“I’ve cut my drinking down. And I’m going to spoil my daughter rotten but not so much that she turns into a spoiled little bitch. Her mum’s too wonderful a person to let that happen. I’m not, but she is.”</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, Matthew Goode, who has a net worth of $3 million, worked alongside Matthew Rhys&nbsp;on a TV show named Wine, which would be a dream job for any Wine Enthusiast.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-193 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>The show&nbsp;previewed&nbsp;him and Rhys&nbsp;sitting under the Tuscan Sun in the Italian Countryside, drinking and enjoying fine wine.</p><p style=text-align:justify>But despite his wine drinking habit on-screen, Matt is a good father, as well&nbsp;as an excellent husband. Matthew earlier dropped a bomb in 2014 when he implied that he had gotten married to Sophie in a wedding ceremony after the birth of his second child while talking to <span style=background-color:#fff;font-family:roboto,sans-serif;font-size:16.8px>HitFix.</span></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>You May Also Like:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Kierston Wareing, Husbandless, Was Pregnant While on 'EastEnders': About Miscarriage and Ex-Boyfriends</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>The duo&nbsp;has been a part&nbsp;of various appearances together, from attending parties to movie premiers to Red Carpets.

He famously played the role of Princess Margaret's rebound Lord Snowdon in The Crown’s second season. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-195 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Well, this was not the first time he played a part in a costume drama.
