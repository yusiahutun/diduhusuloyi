Your morning commute may turn into a run-in with a street mob of paparazzi waiting outside of a show, your subway ride may result in you being an accidental extra in a photo shoot and your go-to spot for Sunday dinner is probably now hosting an influencer brand event. If you’re into the action and celebrity appeal of Fashion Week, these temporary changes are exciting. If you’re not into it—maybe some inside information about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fashion Week hot spots </a>will change your mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/nyfw-street-style.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/elsa-hosk.jpg><p>One of my personal favorite parts about Fashion Week is that you never know who you’re going to run into. Two nights ago, I sat across from Jeff Bezos at the debut fashion show for STAUD at The Plaza Hotel. While I couldn’t tell you where Bezos went after the show, I do have insight on the NYC “hot spots” from 16 other high-profile Fashion Week attendees.</p><p>While the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>runway shows and exclusive events</a> are always star-studded, there are plenty of places to run into your favorite celebrity or influencer that aren’t on the official Fashion Week schedule. As I write this story in-between shows, I’m sitting in the swanky bar at The Beekman Hotel—Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu (you may know her as Sylive in Emily in Paris), just walked in and is carrying her own luggage. It’s these unexpected moments during the week’s downtime that I love the most.&nbsp;</p><p>To get a better sense of where the NYC cool crowd likes to spend their free time, I asked models, writers, content creators, podcast hosts, and DJs (or some combination of that list) what their favorite place to spend their off-time is during the week. Keep reading—maybe these hot spots will make your list of favorites too.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Age: </strong>32</p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Drag Performer / Model</p><p>“My favorite spot(s) during fashion week for the last five to six years is The Boom Boom Room at The Standard Hotel mostly because it’s all my peers [there] whether they’re stylists, fellow models, or influencers finally unwinding from a crazy few weeks. Recently though, I’ve been really enjoying Paul’s Dolls at Paul’s Casablanca in TriBeCa. It happens on Wednesday during fashion week and what I enjoy the most is that you will always be surprised at what A-list celebrities you’ll catch there buying you a drink.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Age</strong>: 29</p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Entrepreneur / Queen of Confidence / Icon / CEO of @letsfuckingdate</p><p>“My favorite spot during fashion week is the glam chair. If there’s one thing about me, it’s that I’m addicted to glam. It’s not just that I get to look good—the actual process from conception to completion makes it my favorite part of fashion week. For me, it’s like creating an ad for a brand or creating a card game—I love collaboration with different creatives and in this case, artists who use my face as their canvas to make wearable art!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Age:</strong> 24</p><p><strong>Occupation: </strong>Fashion Content Creator</p><p>“I love to go refresh my closet at James Veloria. I have been going there since last summer and I love to walk through the chaos of the streets of Chinatown and grab a delicious bite around there. I also love to go eat Italian in the warm and cozy vibes of Morandi. Fashion week can be so intense and I love to go to places that are chill and delicious. Last season, I went there after a busy evening and it was so comforting!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;29</p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong>&nbsp;Influencer / TV Personality</p><p>“Fashion week is a moment where you’re reminded that what you think is cool actually isn’t cool, being true to yourself through fashion and other daily things is.&nbsp;Too many [favorite spots] to choose from! Wo Hop in Chinatown, Village Square Pizza (basic, I know), Saint Theos, and Maman.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Age: </strong>21</p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Host / Content Creator</p><p>“Boom Room is one of the chicest bars in Manhattan because you get 360 views of NYC. I’ve been going there for three years. I feel like I’m in a Sex and the City episode when I’m there. And don’t forget to use the restroom… you can see the Empire State Building while you pee!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Age:</strong> 28</p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Fashion PR</p><p>“For drinks, I love going to Crosby Street Hotel or The Bowery Hotel because it is always fun to run into friends and the vibe is perfect. For relaxation, I love going to get a facial at Christine Chin before the madness begins!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Age:</strong> 33</p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong> DJ</p><p>“I would say Indochine it’s still a great spot during fashion week or ending up at The Box after the after-parties. By 2 a.m., everyone’s trying to go to another spot and that spot is The Box. I’ve been going to the box since 2016. It’s just the perfect NYC club. You never know who you’re going to see or what you’re going to see. It’s dingy and dark but still fab and fun while having a door policy and dress code.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Age:</strong> 25</p><p><strong>Occupation: </strong>Freelance Photographer / Content Creator</p><p>“My favorite spot during fashion is a small Wine Bar in the east village called Ruffian! I’ve been going to Ruffian for 3 years now. I would even call myself a regular. My best friend Wynne and I made it our mission to become regulars somewhere in NYC. And what better spot than a natural wine bar? Why I love going to Ruffian, especially during Fashion Week, is because it feels like an escape from the fast pace. I can unwind with a chilled orange wine while munching on their fabulous pita bread in peace.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Age:</strong> 26</p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Model / Content Creator</p><p>“Lucien is the best spot during NYFW to grab an espresso martini and get ready for a fabulous night out. I’ve been going to Lucien for five years and&nbsp;it’s always the most fun during NYFW. Models, celebrities, designers, stressed production girlies everyone bumps elbows while they slice into their steak frites and gossip about the best and worst dressed amongst their peers.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Age: </strong>28</p><p><strong>Occupation</strong>: Influencer / Writer</p><p>“I love any Fashion Week event that happens at an unexpected location, like a random building that I’ve never been in. It adds to the excitement of Fashion Week. It’s also fun to ride the subway in September because you can always tell who’s headed to a show. People are always pulling looks here but they definitely pull harder during fashion week. I’ve been riding the subway for 10 years now and it is one of the best places for people watching and finding inspiration.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Age:</strong> 24</p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Downtown It-Girl</p><p>“My favorite place during fashion week is Indochine! I love stopping there with friends for a bite to eat or some drinks whenever there may be a few hours between shows. The entire staff there is amazing and the vibes there are always fabulous! There’s so much history there and you can always count on a celebrity sighting or two.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Age:</strong> 30</p><p><strong>Occupation: </strong>Freelance Fashion Writer / Content Creator</p><p>“King Tai, a bar in Crown Heights. As soon as I’m done with shows for the day I literally run back home to Brooklyn for a cocktail before getting work done at night. I’ve been going to King Tai for five years but really became a regular during the pandemic when outdoor seating started back up. I developed friendships with the bar staff. The pop-up food is always so good especially the grilled oysters by Flatbush Oyster Co. I’ve had birthday drinks here, I’ve dragged friends visiting for Fashion Week here for a low-key Brooklyn experience, I even got engaged here—it’s just special to me. You can relax, and debrief in peace because it’s not overhyped. You’re likely not going to find other NYFW goers, TikTokers, or super young bar hoppers here. After the first day of shows wraps you can find me here.&nbsp;”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Age: </strong>33</p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong> DJ</p><p>“The go-to spot on a Wednesday is without a doubt Paul’s Dolls at Paul’s Casablanca. The party thrown by NYC staple doll Linux has been going on for over a year. I love the mixture of the crowd especially. It brings together a stylish mix of girls, gays and theys from all walks of life who pack it up every week to dance and mingle like some sort of big house party on the West Side. Unexpected special guests are bound to appear and the vibe is always correct.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;51</p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong>&nbsp;Entrepreneur / Jewelry Designer</p><p>“My favorite spot to go during NYFW is Indochine!

The food is fabulous and the scene is so chic.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;24</p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong>&nbsp;Influencer / Podcast Host</p><p>“I absolutely love stopping by the nearest Juice Generation to grab my favorite OPP Protein Smoothie. Being on the go in between events can make it tough to find time to nourish my body so this smoothie Is my go-to. I also always take a ginger shot for a midday pick-me-up&nbsp;and immunity boost!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p><strong>Age:</strong>&nbsp;31</p><p><strong>Occupation:</strong>&nbsp;Model / DJ</p><p>“I love Temple Bar and Spring Place. I’ve been going for the last few years to each as I love the staff at both. I love the grown and sexy energy one where you can listen to great music and still be able to lounge or have great conversation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8uinZ6rpK65pnnTq5ynnKNkfnd%2Fl3BubGeWlsCptc6nZLCdlaB6qbvTZqqpp6SofA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffashion-week-hot-spots.html&text=Where%20the%20NYFW%20Crowd%20Eats%2c%20Drinks%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Parties&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffashion-week-hot-spots.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffashion-week-hot-spots.html&title=Where%20the%20NYFW%20Crowd%20Eats%2c%20Drinks%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Parties" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffashion-week-hot-spots.html&title=Where%20the%20NYFW%20Crowd%20Eats%2c%20Drinks%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Parties" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffashion-week-hot-spots.html&title=Where%20the%20NYFW%20Crowd%20Eats%2c%20Drinks%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Parties" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffashion-week-hot-spots.html&description=Where%20the%20NYFW%20Crowd%20Eats%2c%20Drinks%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Parties" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./too-hot-to-handle-drinking-game-23-06-21.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="  Too Hot to Handle season 2 drinking game: Rules to play IRL!
