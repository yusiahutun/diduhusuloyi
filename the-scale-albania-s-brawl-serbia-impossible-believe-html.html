Take it to the sidelines, get it off the pitch, get on with the game. It had been a surreal, almost filmlike sequence and an act of stunning provocation – but there was time to salvage matters.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But Albania’s players wanted their flag and, after Andi Lila and Taulant Xhaka had wrestled Mitrovic for it, it ended up in the hands of striker Bekim Balaj – well known for scoring a superb winner against Portugal last month.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>What followed was a blur, a rush and swirl of people and movements that I was only able to piece together correctly upon returning from the stadium. At the time, it was impossible to believe your eyes: in years of covering football at home and abroad, nothing had come close to this.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>As Balaj made to leave the field, substitutes and officials from both sides had entered the fray – joined, somehow, by fans who had found it surprisingly easy to burst the massed ranks of police.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>One supporter made for Balaj with a chair; he was wrestled to the ground by Lorik Cana, the Albanian captain and ex-Sunderland player, who detained him there for a almost a minute while chaos unfolded around him.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Another, entering the pitch from the other side, made for visiting players too. This unholy mix of players, staff, police and fans piled in – and for a moment you had no idea where it would end.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>It did come to a close, eventually, when the Albanian players made a run for the players’ tunnel in the south-east corner. This was always going to be the lesser of several evils, but it didn’t stop the being pelted with missiles from the Serbian ultras – stationed in that very corner, right below my seat in the press box, and set upon by another pitch invader.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><img id=i-b79dd21413076a74 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/14/1413317353560_wps_65_Fans_of_Serbia_burn_a_NAT.jpg height=387 width=634 alt="Serbia fans burn a NATO flag during the Group I qualifying game at the Partizan Stadium&nbsp;- it is not known whether the fans shown in this picture were involved in the disorder" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Serbia fans burn a NATO flag during the Group I qualifying game at the Partizan Stadium&nbsp;- it is not known whether the fans shown in this picture were involved in the disorder</p><img id=i-1903cef181c24e24 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/14/1413319103508_wps_84_A_drone_with_an_Albanian_.jpg height=424 width=634 alt="The flag flies above the pitch with the score at 0-0 just before half time in Belgrade" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The flag flies above the pitch with the score at 0-0 just before half time in Belgrade</p><img id=i-cbd8322bbf3aaa10 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/14/1413319426054_wps_86_image001_png.jpg height=629 width=634 alt="The flag that was flown over the stadium is shown ahead of the game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The flag that was flown over the stadium is shown ahead of the game</p><img id=i-5b2d62ef1d58bf52 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/14/1413318979641_wps_83_Riot_police_clashes_with_.jpg height=430 width=634 alt="One supporter tries to protect himself from the riot police who moved into the stand as tensions boiled over" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>One supporter tries to protect himself from the riot police who moved into the stand as tensions boiled over</p><img id=i-5bf3d882a92d221f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/14/1413317356996_wps_66_Riot_police_clashes_with_.jpg height=456 width=634 alt="Fans clashed with police as havoc took hold in the stands in Belgrade - it is not known whether the fans shown in this picture were involved in the disorder" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Fans clashed with police as havoc took hold in the stands in Belgrade - it is not known whether the fans shown in this picture were involved in the disorder</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>As they crouched and ran, hands over their faces, a Serbian official could be seen covering his own in evident despair a little behind them.

It came, 15 minutes or so later, that the match would continue. By now, the ranks of police separating stands from pitch were three or four deep; a presence whose like I have never witnessed at any sporting event.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Out came Serbia manager Dick Advocaat and a few of his substitutes a little after that; in they came again shortly afterwards. The south stand had been partly cleared by then, and something appeared to be up. Sure enough, news filtered through that Atkinson had abandoned the match.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Serbia emerged from the tunnel anyway, moving to the centre circle and applauding the fans who remained. But there was little to applaud in Belgrade on Tuesday night. An event that had been given every opportunity to pass peacefully had ended in turmoil whose repercussions may be felt beyond football.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Few supporters remained outside an eerily quiet ground when I finally left an hour later. All was calm again but, just as had been the case before Atkinson stopped play, that told none of the story.</span></p><img id=i-4c2d2f0e481a82b4
