He got some of those good looks that had her on Playboy, and he also inherited some of her acting talent.&nbsp;</p><p>Jayne Mansfield was like a force of nature in the entertainment world while she lived.&nbsp;She established a career as a prominent Hollywood sex symbol during the 1950s and early 1960s. However, not many knew that she was also a dedicated mother.&nbsp;</p><p>Her impact on Tony and his siblings’ lives is evident in who they’ve become and that they are always quick to praise her for being such a great mom. Keep reading to learn more about Tony Cimber and what he’s said about Jayne Mansfield as a mother.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tonyy.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Tony_Cimber></span>Who Is Tony Cimber?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tony Cimber is the product of Jayne Mansfield’s marriage to director Matt Cimber. The pair were married in 1965 but got divorced in 1966.&nbsp;Tony, whose full name is Antonio Raphael Ottaviano Cimber, was born on October 18, 1965, one year before they called it quits.&nbsp;</p><p>Like his parents, he also chose to establish a career in Hollywood, becoming an actor and director.&nbsp;He’s worked on shows like “The Original Ladies of Wrestling,” “GLOW: Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling” and “Mystery: Mysteries of Cathedrals.” His father, Matt Cimber, joined hands with him to become the co-creator of GLOW.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Old_Is_Tony_Cimber></span>How Old Is Tony Cimber?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tony Cimber was born on October 18, 1965, under the Libra zodiac, which makes him 58 years old as of 2023.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/jaynee.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Did_Tony_Cimber_Say_About_Jayne_Mansfield></span>What Did Tony Cimber Say About Jayne Mansfield?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As a Hollywood sex symbol, nobody expects you to have kids you dote over. At least not five of them.&nbsp;However, that is precisely how Jayne Mansfield was. She had a thriving career as an actress and a sex symbol gorgeous enough to compete with Marilyn Monroe.&nbsp;</p><p>Did that affect her duty as a mother? Barely. According to her son, Tony, Jayne was very driven, but she never joked about her role as a mother.&nbsp;He claimed she was a “good” mom who “cared so much” about her children. She wanted to <a href=#>spend </a>as much time as she could with them and would even take them with her on the road to achieve that.&nbsp;</p><p>There was no doubt about her devotion to her children. However, her public image made it a bit difficult.&nbsp;For example, her first husband, Paul Mansfield, tried to gain custody of their daughter Jayne Marie in 1956, using her appearance in Playboy as evidence that she was not fit to be a mother.</p><p>Of course, Jayne was more than qualified for the role, and all her kids, not just Tony, have praised her for being a great mom.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tony_Cimbers_Siblings></span>Tony Cimber’s Siblings&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Aside from Tony Cimber, Jayne Mansfield was a proud mom to 4 other children.&nbsp;Her oldest child is Jayne Marie Mansfield, a product of her marriage to Paul Mansfield.</p><p>She followed in her mom’s footsteps to become a Playboy Playmate and actress.&nbsp;Tony’s siblings include Mickey Jr. Hargitay, Zoltan Hargitay, and Mariska Hargitay.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Mariska_Hargitay_at_Shubert_Theatre_in_NYC_November_2011-fotor-20231103163521.jpg><p>They have all gotten involved in showbiz, though in different capacities. Among them, Mariska is arguably the most successful, thanks to her long-running appearance on the hit show “Law & Order: SVU.”&nbsp;</p><p>Like Tony, she has also been very vocal about how great a mother Jayne Mansfield had been before her demise.&nbsp;Mariska and her full-blood siblings were kids when Jayne died, but even they already knew they had a good mother in her.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, Mariska opened up about losing her mom as a child. She said: “The way I’ve lived with loss is to lean into it. As the saying goes, the only way out is through. In my life, certainly, I’ve tried to avoid pain, loss, and feeling things. But I’ve learned instead to real­ly lean into it because sooner or later you have to pay the piper.”&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately, <a href=#>Mariska</a> and Tony still feel her presence and influence. Mariska once shared:&nbsp;“She’s still with me. I look at my life now and think; I’m on a TV show, I run a foundation, I run a household, I’m a mom, I’m a wife, I’m a lot of things. I realize I’m like that because it’s what I know.”</p><p>Tony feels the same. He said: “Jayne’s greatest regret would be not growing old with her children. But I can also tell you that she never really left. She lets her presence be known. And it’s so Jayne.”</p><p>Jayne has been dead for decades, but as long as Tony Cimber and his siblings are still around, nobody will forget how great she was as a mother and global superstar.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kwbC62GaaoqWSmr9utM6wZKiklGK2tHnJmrCnnV2irq%2B%2FxaKcpZyjYsCwuoynprBn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftony-cimber-how-old-is-jayne-mansfields-son-now.html&text=Tony%20Cimber%3a%20How%20Old%20Is%20Jayne%20Mansfield%27s%20Son%20Now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftony-cimber-how-old-is-jayne-mansfields-son-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftony-cimber-how-old-is-jayne-mansfields-son-now.html&title=Tony%20Cimber%3a%20How%20Old%20Is%20Jayne%20Mansfield%27s%20Son%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftony-cimber-how-old-is-jayne-mansfields-son-now.html&title=Tony%20Cimber%3a%20How%20Old%20Is%20Jayne%20Mansfield%27s%20Son%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftony-cimber-how-old-is-jayne-mansfields-son-now.html&title=Tony%20Cimber%3a%20How%20Old%20Is%20Jayne%20Mansfield%27s%20Son%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftony-cimber-how-old-is-jayne-mansfields-son-now.html&description=Tony%20Cimber%3a%20How%20Old%20Is%20Jayne%20Mansfield%27s%20Son%20Now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./how-does-deep-fake-love-on-netflix-work.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="  How does Deep Fake Love on Netflix work?
