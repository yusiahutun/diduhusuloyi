They also provided us with the materials we needed, that is the magnetic ink card reader and the cards themselves that we were to use," Mercy said.<p class=align-left>The teenagers then developed the Mwananchi Card which is swiped through a magnetic card reader connected to a computer to display information on card's owner.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: CS Matiang'i insists NIIMS roll-out will go on as planned despite Senate suspending it</strong></p><p class=align-left>She and her project partner Lorraine were among finalists who were picked to present science projects during the YSK 2018 exhibitions at Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC).</p><p class=align-left>Their wish was to meet President Uhuru Kenyatta so they could present to him their concept.

Efforts to reach Mucheru were also futile.</p><p class=align-left>On his part, Mucheru advised schools should not only support but also manage students' expectations when coming up with ideas.</p>"The youths themselves have a responsibility to research and see 'is this thing of mine that I am thinking about new or has it existed elsewhere' so that they do not get disappointed," the CS told Citizen TV.<p class=align-left>It was not immediately clear whether or not Mercy and Lorraine's concept had been patented.</p><p class=align-left><strong><i>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
