The former US pro golfer is a big social media personality who has surpassed the number of Instagram followers of golf legends like Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/paige.jpg><p>Her Instagram account has over three million followers and continues to rise daily.&nbsp;Paige had retired from professional golf but had a great career as an amateur, which is why it sounded weird when she revealed how jealous she was of her sister Lexie Spiranac.&nbsp;</p><p>Keep reading to discover what we know about Lexie and her rivalry with Paige.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Lexie_Spiranac></span>Who Is Lexie Spiranac?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lexie Spiranac is Paige Spiranac’s older sister, rival, and business partner.&nbsp;She was born on April 26, 1984, in Chicago, Illinois, United States. However, she was raised in Monument, Colorado, where she lived with her sister and parents for some time.</p><p>Lexie was also an athlete who reportedly bagged a college athletic scholarship at the prestigious Stanford, where she went on to compete on the track and field team. She was a part of the 4A State Championship team in 2004 and won the state championship in the 5A high jump in 2007.&nbsp;</p><p>Lexie broke her best record in the high jump category at the collegiate level by clearing 1.63m.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Lexie-Spiranac-Net-Worth-1024x983.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lexie_Spiranac_Parents></span>Lexie Spiranac Parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her parents are believed to have Croatian roots and are very athletic. Lexie’s father is Dan Spiranac, a sportsperson. Her mother is Annette Spiranac.</p><p>Dan was a member of the college football team called Pittsburgh Panther, which competed for the National Championship in 1976. Her mother, Annette, was known as a professional ballerina, while her sister Paige Spiranac has become a household name in golfing circles.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lexie_Spiranac_Husband></span>Lexie Spiranac Husband&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Paige’s sister enjoys fame today because of her popularity. Barring that, Lexie prefers a private life, so there’s not much to go on regarding her personal life.&nbsp;However, since there are barely any traces of a husband linked to her on the Internet, the athletic woman is believed to be still searching for the one.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lexie_Spiranac_and_Paige_Spiranacs_Relationship></span>Lexie Spiranac and Paige Spiranac’s Relationship<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Loving parents raised Lexie and Paige, and they share a great bond. However, despite that, they experienced a fierce sibling rivalry as kids, with one trying to one-up the other with their ability.&nbsp;The sisters have both admitted to being jealous of each other for different reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Paige once said: “The thing about Lexie is that she’s brilliant. She was a black belt in Taekwondo. She’s taller than me. She’s stronger than me. And so I never had any advantage over her.”&nbsp;</p><p>She also said: “I couldn’t fight her because she would literally kill me. I think I was jealous of you. Because Dad pretty much raised you. You had a lot more freedom than I had.”</p><p>While Paige had to work her way up the ranks as a young golfer, Lexie, who is older by three years, was a top heptathlete who got a scholarship to the prestigious Stanford University in California.</p><p>It was a remarkable feat, but it didn’t stop Lexie from equally being jealous of Paige.&nbsp;</p><p>She <a href=#>said</a>: “I was jealous of you because of the attention mom and dad gave you because of your exceptional abilities in sports. That was my problem. Mom didn’t understand high school. So when I got into Stanford, nobody knew it was a big deal.”&nbsp;</p><p>Lexie added, “So I think I was a little jealous that mom related to you more because she understood that kind of achievement and didn’t really understand test scores.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ppge.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Are_Page_and_Lexie_Spiranac_Now></span>Where Are Page and Lexie Spiranac Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Spiranac sisters may be old rivals, but that has not stopped them from working together. These days, they work hand in hand, building Paige’s brand.</p><p>Paige once confessed: “For people who don’t know, Lexie is part of my team. She works with me. We pretty much communicate every single day about business.”</p><p>Lexie also said: “I’m kind of business manager, but I ensure this ship stays afloat. Paige is a media company. It’s always kind of hard to explain [my job] because no one’s ever done this in golf.”</p><p>The two sisters continue to thrive in their endeavors, reminding many of <a href=#>Serena Williams</a> and her sister, whose rivalry on the court did not affect their bond.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuabEyJ5krKiZp66vrcKsZKyho6mys3nIrGSrnaCkv7Wxw6WwZqKVlrmwwdJmpp9lmJq%2FbrTEq5ysZaedxnA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flexie-spiranacs-sister-is-reportedly-jealous-of-her-heres-why.html&text=Lexie%20Spiranacs%20Sister%20Is%20Reportedly%20Jealous%20of%20Her%3a%20Heres%20Why&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flexie-spiranacs-sister-is-reportedly-jealous-of-her-heres-why.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flexie-spiranacs-sister-is-reportedly-jealous-of-her-heres-why.html&title=Lexie%20Spiranacs%20Sister%20Is%20Reportedly%20Jealous%20of%20Her%3a%20Heres%20Why" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flexie-spiranacs-sister-is-reportedly-jealous-of-her-heres-why.html&title=Lexie%20Spiranacs%20Sister%20Is%20Reportedly%20Jealous%20of%20Her%3a%20Heres%20Why" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flexie-spiranacs-sister-is-reportedly-jealous-of-her-heres-why.html&title=Lexie%20Spiranacs%20Sister%20Is%20Reportedly%20Jealous%20of%20Her%3a%20Heres%20Why" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flexie-spiranacs-sister-is-reportedly-jealous-of-her-heres-why.html&description=Lexie%20Spiranacs%20Sister%20Is%20Reportedly%20Jealous%20of%20Her%3a%20Heres%20Why" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bridal-wedding-tiaras.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Should you wear a tiara on your wedding day?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-carrot-top-gay-exploring-the-speculation.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Carrot Top Gay?
