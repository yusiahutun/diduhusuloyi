The side accent braid with curls</h2><p class=align-left>The side accent braid with curls is as complex as its name suggests.

Tie it in place and twirl the remaining hair around the bun and pin it. It is a typical south Indian wedding hairstyle for round chubby face.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs5slni5e2dqp.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Best short natural hairstyles for ladies 2018</span></p></a><h2>18. The double crown braid</h2><p class=align-left>The crown braided double bun is a unique hairstyle that will light you up for your wedding. First, the hair is to be split diagonally to create two sections. Clip the bigger section at the top. The lower section is braided to the very end and tied using an elastic band, so it does not become loose again. The braid is then loosened with small tugs that are uniform throughout. The same is repeated for the upper bigger section. The first section is then folded into a bun at the top and pinned to remain in shape. The bun is folded flat to look like a crown. The other section is folded in the same way to have what appears like two crowns. Unlike the Indian wedding hairstyles for fuller faces, this one can fit any face type easily.</p><h2>19. Simple side braid</h2><p class=align-left>The simple side braid is a simple hairstyle, but with the right accessories, it looks pretty nice. With this hairstyle, braiding starts from the side. A small portion of hair is reserved for the side fringe though. Hair is gradually added to the braid until it is entirely in the side braid. The braid is then loosened by pulling it slightly. Curl the side fringe with the help of a curling iron and then accessorize it with flowers and pearls.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs7ad14jvs52j.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyan hairstyles for round faces</span></p></a><h2>20. The elegant bun</h2><p class=align-left>The elegant bun is a work of perfection and precision. The hair is split into three sections. The centre section ought to be bigger while the other two are about the same size. The bigger middle section is then tied into a high ponytail. The ponytail is lifted and a doughnut band placed underneath it using hair pins. The ponytail is then pulled down. Hair is arranged to cover the doughnut band from the top. An elastic band is used to hold it in place. Merge the loose hair with the lower ponytail by folding it.
