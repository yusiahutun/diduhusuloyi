So she suddenly found herself available when fellow Lies alum Laura Dern reached out about a new series—a period comedy Dern was producing about the Slim Aarons–esque world of Palm Beach in 1969. “I didn’t even need to read the script,” Friedberg tells Harper’s Bazaar. “It was like, ‘Oh my God—yes, yes, yes!’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Friedberg found herself immersed in sun-drenched 1960s south Florida, as created by directors Abe Sylvia, Stephanie Laing, and Tate Taylor—a world that was colorful, intoxicating, and filled with joy. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a60230906/ricky-martin-palm-royale-interview-2024/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ricky Martin" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Ricky Martin</a> playing a pool boy?

Sign us up!</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The fashion is no less delightful. As Friedberg notes, Palm Royale is set in the era of Lily Pulitzer, cashmere twin sets, and ladies “bothered by nothing other than their martinis and their golf game.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Much of the show—based on Juliet McDaniel’s 2018 novel Mr. & Mrs. American Pie—was costumed in actual designer vintage from the period. And perhaps the comedy’s best punch line of all is that literal top model <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a60228986/kaia-gerber-ayo-edebiri-matching-tattoos/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kaia Gerber" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Kaia Gerber</a>’s character, manicurist Mitzi, spends a lot of the 10 episodes in a dowdy nail-tech smock—yet somehow makes it work. And that, as we learn, is what Palm Royale is all about: taking what you have, and making it work.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below, we quiz Friedberg about the series, whose first three episodes are streaming now.</p><img alt="palm royale" title="palm royale" width=5888 height=3926 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/palm-royale-photo-010105-65fb0f39448f9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Erica Parise</span></p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What made this specific late-’60s moment interesting to work with?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It was exciting, because there is so much documentation of that time in fashion, and the 1960s in general—but Palm Beach was kind of this bubble. We had the feminine uprising and counterculture and antiwar movements happening in L.A. and New York, whereas Palm Beach was this untouched bubble of people bothered by nothing other than their martinis and their golf game. They’re a fun and plastic society.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What was the research process like?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My go-to is always the <a href=# title=https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.westerncostumeresearch.com__;!!Ivohdkk!lH8YjYeRbEg9iWYWw6vqs0hEc1tIacB6nEllz1It0o8oc-ECxxE-ci0PqfNb5Z8X7kn-0OBkCl76G24nZVVVXzuweVzHGz9R$ name=undefined data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.westerncostumeresearch.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Western Costume Co.

We took our research right from the pages of magazines from the 1960s. We went to the society pages to see these real galas that were really happening.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>I often think about tabloids from the 2000s and 2010s, and the “Who wore it best?” articles.

Those who-wore-it-bests throw you right into the exact moment in fashion. And I think it’s even getting more and more encyclopedic, with social media documenting everything that’s happening in fashion.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Were there any real society ladies from the 1960s who inspired your costumes?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Betsy Bloomingdale was a big one.

We also looked to Marjorie Merriweather Post, who built the mansion Mar-a-Lago. We based Carol Burnett’s character, Norma, on a lot of those types of figures.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Did you source a lot of vintage for Palm Royale?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We got pretty lucky in that there is a lot of designer vintage in pretty great shape still around from the 1960s. I would say 50 percent of our principal cast is in sourced designer vintage pieces, and the other 50 percent we built. The background characters are probably 90 percent in vintage.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Where did you find all this vintage?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Etsy is an enormously great source—I don’t know what the heck we did without it before! It gets all the vintage stores across the U.S. on one platform. We got a lot from L.A. and Palm Springs.</p><img alt="alison janney palm royale" title="alison janney palm royale" width=5751 height=3834 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/palm-royale-photo-010205-65fb0fbfe998e.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Erica Parise</span></p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Any vintage highlights you were especially happy to find?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We had so many gowns—so many. We had a gala or a party in almost every episode, and each one had to feel different. Each woman has her own theme, too. Kristin Wiig’s character, Maxine, is living out of a suitcase in a motel in West Palm Beach, trying to get an invitation to the exclusive Palm Royale club, so she visits her great-aunt Norma and steals gowns from her—but all those gowns are a little outdated, because Norma has been in a coma for a few years. There is this one scene in particular where Maxine walks into a pool in this vintage Malcolm Starr canary-yellow chiffon gown. We needed three of them, and ended up finding the exact gown online on Etsy. This Malcolm Starr canary-yellow gown from the ’60s—and we had multiple originals.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Etsy came through!</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Etsy came through in a major way. There are a lot of standout costumes. There’s this one that Maxine wears in episode 10 that we made based on a Balenciaga pattern from 1967—we saw a <a href=# title="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWi1hARRfvQ__;!!Ivohdkk!lH8YjYeRbEg9iWYWw6vqs0hEc1tIacB6nEllz1It0o8oc-ECxxE-ci0PqfNb5Z8X7kn-0OBkCl76G24nZVVVXzuwefkSKNL6$" name=undefined data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWi1hARRfvQ" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="clip on YouTube" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">clip on YouTube</a> of this runway show, where the model comes down some stairs and takes off her cape—only it’s not really a cape, it’s a little bow at the neck, and it just reveals almost the same dress underneath. It was perfect for Maxine’s character—it captured that silliness and over-the-top-ness.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You have such an incredible cast on this show. But I need to ask: What was it like working with Kaia Gerber, an actual high-fashion model?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her character is sort of on the fringe—she’s a manicurist in West Palm Beach who is kind of a therapist. She wears a nail-tech smock almost the whole time. It’s quite funny! [The character] doesn’t realize how beautiful she is, and it’s so obvious to everyone else. She was great. Obviously it’s a breeze to dress a model that can work anything you put on them.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You put Kaia Gerber in a smock?!</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Of all the women in the show, her costumes have the least fashion. It’s ridiculous.</p><img alt="kristen wiig palm royale" title="kristen wiig palm royale" width=5829 height=3886 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/palm-royale-photo-010106-65fb0ee89dddf.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Erica Parise</span></p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What is it like to costume Kristen Wiig?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kristen was phenomenal. She goes in hook, line, and sinker—she doesn’t do anything halfway, and that’s why she’s so good. All of the choices we made for Maxine were incredibly collaborative. She starts out very doll-like, with a lot of miniskirts, a spray tan, and very blonde hair. Sometimes you worry about clothes that have so much pattern and color taking over a scene. But each costume we did—and we did hundreds for her—each time was purposeful and makes so much sense for the scene and the character. Kristen loves clothes, color, she loves a strange and asymmetrical cut, but she also knows her character. She uses costumes and makeup as a real conduit to get into her characters.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What was the hardest costume to get right?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There is a scene with some underwater shots of Maxine in a gown, so we made her a gown that was empire waist in shocking pink with lots of flowers. We used about 20 yards of chiffon for each skirt, and it was a lot of fabric, a lot of layers, and we knew it wasn’t going to be the most comfortable to be filming underwater in 20 yards of chiffon—but we knew how important it was to see that skirt underwater moving around. Kristen was able to understand that her comfort came second to how good that skirt looked underwater, and I love her for that.</p><h2 data-node-id=35 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Was there anything your actors tried to steal from the costume department?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We had some Gucci shoes we made for Allison Janney’s character that she kept wanting to “borrow.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/14c3069f-31a0-4f5a-9c90-463bf7712183_1703600547.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Todd Plummer" title="Headshot of Todd Plummer" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Todd Plummer is a Boston-based writer who covers style, entertainment, and travel.
