He represented the black community in a way, that used music to advocate for equality and social change. He even moved on from the gangsta rap trend of the 90s to bring the message of inner-city communities to people’s attention.</p><p>Shakur lost his life in 1996 after a shooting in Las Vegas. However, the police never found the perpetrators. Another mysterious subject related to Pak is his children; if there were any or not.</p><p>Since then, several allegations have been made, all stating that the murdered rapper Tupac Shakuri had a secret daughter who is alive and well today. And Jaycee is another hot suspect that internet communities have not been able to forget – everyone wonders if Jaycee is really the biological daughter of Me Against The World singer <a href=#>Tupac Shakur</a>.</p><h2><strong>How is Jaycee Shakur Got Related To Tupac Shakur?</strong></h2><p>On 20 July 2021, Jaycee Shakur, a TikTok star with the username <a href=# rel=noopener>@boogiebentley</a>, posted a video with the caption: ‘I am Tupac’s daughter. Shakur was already famous on TikTok with 100 thousand followers. After the launch of the recording, she immediately gained huge attention.</p><p>She got millions of likes, views, and debates from Tupac’s fans and other likers. Her statement attracted flocks of theories, refreshed stories that went by, and mysteries and created a lot of confusion on social media. Some believed her, others did not; in fact, it became another example of the Mandela effect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jaycee-and-Tupac-Shakur.jpg><p>Millions of people started sharing her photos on the internet. Moreover, the picture of a young woman posing in a striped T-shirt did indeed bear a striking resemblance to the deceased hip-hop star.</p><p>However, no one knows for sure whether she was telling the truth or simply trying to promote her reach. Moreover, she did not provide any evidence to make people believe that she was indeed Tupac’s daughter. But was Jaycee Shakur’s alleged father Tupac’s daughter?</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>What Does Kelly Tisdale Do? Untold Details About Mike Myers’ Wife</a></strong></p><h2><strong>But Did Jaycee Shakur’s Alleged Father, Tupac Really Have A Child Before He Died?</strong></h2><p>Many Tupac fans claim that there are several people in the rap community who are aware of the fact that the artist had a daughter. However, they try to protect her from the pressure of being in the spotlight.</p><p>Since Makaveli died, some people have persistently denied his death, raising several conjectures and possibilities.</p><p>Among them, one of the most famous claims is that Tupac faked his death and went to live with his aunt in Cuba, where he had a family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tupac-With-Daughter.jpg><p>Photographs of the rapper also appear from time to time. Another photograph once surfaced showing him allegedly with pop star Rihanna – despite the fact that he died when she was only eight years old.</p><p>Many argue that the fact that Tupac did not have children is unlikely, as the bandage-wearer dated many women, including celebrities such as Madonna and possibly Jada Pinkett Smith. He was also the husband of Keisha Morris, who was studying criminal law when they met. However, their marriage ended after only about 5 months.</p><p>In the last moments of his life, he had a serious relationship with Kidada Jones, the daughter of Quincy Jones. However, there was never any headline announcing that he had become the father of a child/children.</p><h2><strong>Tupac Did Want To Have Kids</strong></h2><p>The theory that Tupac’s children are stellar is made more so by the fact that there are reports saying that the MC New York really wanted him to have children himself.</p><p>As mentioned, Tupac was married to Keisha Morris. After their marriage, Tupac talked about having children with Keisha.</p><p>His ex-wife Morris once revealed to <a href=# rel=noopener>Source magazine</a>,</p><p>“Tupac picked out names he wanted to move to Arizona and name our Daughter Star and our son Michelangelo.”</p><p>She added that one of the reasons they could not have offspring was because Tupac smoked pot. It allegedly affected the fertility of the actor and his wife Juice.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Meet Melia McEnery: Some Untold Facts About Eric Clapton’s Wife</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Further Theories That Suggest Jaycee Shakur Might Be Tupac’s Daughter</strong></h2><p>The theory of the fake death of the New Yorker is also supported by a line from <a href=#>Busta Rhymes</a>‘ 1997 album When Disaster Strikes. It also contributes to the hypothesis that the gangster rapper did have a daughter.</p><p>The ‘thank you’ section clearly states that he had a daughter, as the verse states,</p><p>Tupac: soldier, warrior, may Allah bless your family, your daughter, her mother, your mother (Afeni Shakur)</p><p>Some candid family photographs confirm this conjecture. One of the photographs shows 2Pac and Afeni (his mother) holding a little girl, apparently at a family event. Looking at all these pictures above, it is quite difficult to deny the aspect that the All Eyez On Me rapper had a baby girl.</p><p>All the evidence points in some way to his child being a girl (i.e. a daughter).</p><p>Be that as it may, the obvious truth is that the rapper remained childless his entire life. And no one from his immediate entourage has come forward and stated that he would indeed have offspring.</p><h2><strong>But Who Actually Is Jaycee Shakur?</strong></h2><p>As popular as she became by uploading a TikTok video, her true identity is nothing short of a mystery. Although she is quite active on TikTok, Shakur has hardly mentioned her real parents or her origins.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jaycee-Shaku.jpg><p>From her high-energy internet antics, she looks very much like a teenager and is apparently a big fan of the late Diamond-certified artist. Jaycee has also not given any interviews in connection with that July 2021 TikTok excitement.</p><h2><strong>Quick Facts About Jaycee Shakur</strong></h2><table><tbody readability=8><tr><td><strong>Full Real Name</strong></td><td>Jaycee Shakur.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td>1993-1996.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age (as of 2021)</strong></td><td>25-28 years old.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>Place of Birth</strong></td><td>New York City, New York, United States.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Tik Tok star, YouTuber, and media face.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>Christianity.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity</strong></td><td>African-American.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Net worth</strong></td><td>USD 1-2 Million (approx.).</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>High School Graduate.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>School/College</strong></td><td>Private School in New York.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Dark Brown.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Height (approx.)</strong></td><td>Feet Inches: 5′ 7″.<br>Meters: 1.70 m.<br>Centimetres: 170 cm.</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Weight (approx.)</strong></td><td>In Kilograms: 54-59 kg.<br>In Pounds: 119-130 lbs.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Black.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Length</strong></td><td>Long.</td></tr></tbody></table><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7XLsmWcp51ktrR5yZqwnJ2VYsCprcquqWasmJp6pa3UoJ%2BtnaJivKd5066nmptdqLWit9SrZK6mpKS5pXnTq6ytoF2Wr7DB02afnqpf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-jaycee-shakur-the-daughter-of-tupac-shakur-untold-truth-about-her.html&text=Is%20Jaycee%20Shakur%20The%20Daughter%20of%20Tupac%20Shakur%3f%20Untold%20Truth%20About%20Her&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-jaycee-shakur-the-daughter-of-tupac-shakur-untold-truth-about-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-jaycee-shakur-the-daughter-of-tupac-shakur-untold-truth-about-her.html&title=Is%20Jaycee%20Shakur%20The%20Daughter%20of%20Tupac%20Shakur%3f%20Untold%20Truth%20About%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-jaycee-shakur-the-daughter-of-tupac-shakur-untold-truth-about-her.html&title=Is%20Jaycee%20Shakur%20The%20Daughter%20of%20Tupac%20Shakur%3f%20Untold%20Truth%20About%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-jaycee-shakur-the-daughter-of-tupac-shakur-untold-truth-about-her.html&title=Is%20Jaycee%20Shakur%20The%20Daughter%20of%20Tupac%20Shakur%3f%20Untold%20Truth%20About%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-jaycee-shakur-the-daughter-of-tupac-shakur-untold-truth-about-her.html&description=Is%20Jaycee%20Shakur%20The%20Daughter%20of%20Tupac%20Shakur%3f%20Untold%20Truth%20About%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1-050-trunk-or-treat.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="#1,050 Trunk or Treat.
