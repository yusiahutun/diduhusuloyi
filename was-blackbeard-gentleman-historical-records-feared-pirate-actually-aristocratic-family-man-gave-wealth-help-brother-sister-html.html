class=mol-para-with-font><span>Treasures found among the wreckage of Blackbeard's ship, Queen Anne's Revenge, suggest the pirate may have had a caring side.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Marine archaeologists found evidence of medical equipment used to heal the sick and wounded on board the pirate captain's vessel.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The artefacts are the latest clues of what life would have been like on the ship that became feared along the east coast of America and the West Indies.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>The wreckage was discovered in 1996 on a sandbar in Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina, where Blackbeard ran it aground in 1718.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Since then archaeologists working on the<a style=font-weight:700 rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#> Queen Anne's Revenge project</a>&nbsp;have recovered cannons, glass beads, coins, pottery and gold dust from the remains of the vessel that have provided a glimpse of the pirates' lifestyle.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But among the wreckage they have also found a number of items that would have been used for medical care, including a syringe, a blood porringer, an apothecary's weight set, along with a mortar and pestle.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Archaeologists who have been studying the artefacts said they suggest Blackbeard made great efforts to keep his crew healthy.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>It is a image that contrasts with the pirate captain's ruthless and ferocious reputation.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'As a crewman in the Royal Navy, he probably did not need the plantation, but it would help his family to survive.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'He fished the Spanish wrecks on the Florida coast like many Jamaicans and followed the growing crowd of exiled ex-privateers to New Providence, where they became branded as "pirates, the "enemies of all mankind."'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Indeed, he argues that many of the stories that grew up around Blackbeard were probably the product of the Crown's attempts to crush piracy in the Caribbean at the time and sought to remove the support former privateers such as Thache had enjoyed among the local inhabitants.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Mr Brooks added: The Board of Trade likely believed the wealthy and ex-Royal Navy man Thache and his fellow privateers threatened their efforts to eradicate piracy in America.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Its members would have sought to prevent Thache from gaining even more popularity and support from his well-born community as a pirate.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'They used every available measure to diminish his reputation.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'Nathaniel Mist, suffering from repeated arrests and fines, may have caved to royal pressure and described 'Blackbeard' as the more 'villainous' character in order to accomplish this purpose.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'As long as few knew of his family and his service, he could be portrayed as wicked and dangerous.'</span></p><p
