They remained together from September&nbsp;1968 till 1970, the year they got divorced.</p><p>Suzzaneshe and John's son is none other than Matthew Perry, also known as Chandler Bing from ‘Friends,' which is, in fact, &nbsp;one of the most famous sitcoms ever made from the 90s.</p><p>Now we know about his family life and children, let’s talk about something else. What about his professional life and net worth?&nbsp;</p><h2>Keith Morrison’s Professional Life and Net Worth:</h2><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Keith Morrison</a> started his career in journalism at the age of 18 in 1966. He worked for several radio&nbsp;stations and television before joining the Canadian CTV Network in 1973 as a correspondent, producer and news anchor. Later in 1986, he acceded to the NBC Network. After two years, he became the West Coast correspondent for NBC Nightly News and Today.</p><p>In 1992, he returned to Canada to become the host of CTV’s morning program. He was also the host of a syndicated program called ‘Down The Road’ but was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">somehow fired</a> or ousted with unclear reasons. Many people have taken his ousting as a network shakeup.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-193 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>He then joined NBC in 1995 and has been a correspondent for ‘Dateline’ ever since.</p><p>His five-decade long run has gained him immense respect, admiration and a big pile of fortune. His previous contracts with CTV have bot been not disclosed. However, according to Indeed.com, Keith is currently enjoying a salary of $128,000 at NBC. The salary&nbsp;undoubtedly contributes in his massive net worth of $1.5 million dollars.</p><h2>Keith Morrison’s short bio:</h2><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Keith Morrison</a>&nbsp;(age - 69) was born on July 2, 1947, in Canada.
