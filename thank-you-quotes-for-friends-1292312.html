Friends are the real gems that one could ever have — a true friend encourages you to do better, lends a helping hand whenever needed, laughs with you, and stays with you during tough times as a rock-solid support.&nbsp;</p><p>“True friends play a vital role in our lives, contributing to our overall well-being and mental health. They provide us with emotional support, understanding, and companionship during both good times and bad. Having true friends fosters a sense of belonging and connection, which are essential for our mental and emotional stability. These relationships offer a safe space where we can express ourselves authentically without fear of judgment. True friends also challenge us to grow and become better versions of ourselves, offering constructive feedback and encouragement along the way,”&nbsp; says Niloufar Esmaeilpour, a Registered Clinical Counselor with the British Columbia Association of Clinical Counselors (R.C.C.).</p><p>True friends play a vital role in our lives, contributing to our overall well-being and mental health.

When we say "thank you" to a friend, we're not just acknowledging their action or gesture; we're also affirming our appreciation for them as a person. This simple act of gratitude communicates to our friends that we value them and the effort they've put into our relationship. It creates a positive feedback loop where our friend feels appreciated and acknowledged, which in turn strengthens their trust and connection with us.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Also, expressing gratitude fosters a sense of reciprocity in the relationship, encouraging our friends to continue supporting us and deepening the bond between us. So, saying "thank you" isn't just polite; it's a meaningful way to cultivate and reinforce the bond we share with our friends.”</p><p>Not able to pen down your feelings?
