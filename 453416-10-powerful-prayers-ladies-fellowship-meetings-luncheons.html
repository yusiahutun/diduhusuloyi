They, therefore, have to ask God to shine a light on their paths so that they may not stray into satan's darkness. Below are excellent examples of prayers for women’s fellowship:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0ff3725b74311d84.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 uplifting opening prayers for a women's group meeting</span></p></a>Almighty Father, we thank you for this amazing meeting and for every individual gathered here.

Whisper your <a href=#>words of wisdom </a>into our hearts so that we may love one another as you desire.
