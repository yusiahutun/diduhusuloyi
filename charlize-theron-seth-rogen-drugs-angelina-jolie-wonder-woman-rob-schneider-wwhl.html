First, she said, "She was pretty old." But when pressed for a number, she shot back, "Eight." Eight?! Eight is pretty old?</p><p>Things went downhill from there, as Charlize revealed that Gerda talks too loud on the phone, only to find out Gerda had no idea she felt that way. Awkward time for that conversation to happen.</p><p>Seth got to have his own awkward conversation with mom when he revealed what annoys him and said, "She's not nice to waiters." Understandably, his mother Sandy wasn't too thrilled with that answer and immediately began to argue the point.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:067d4d54-83c5-5f73-b87c-71dece9ad093 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2487b7fd-b3c1-5af1-92cd-e0a627fd0b9f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/93/5by4/2019/04/05/934877720f7e588f9b7e26d0b0e37d88_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Shockingly' Single Charlize Theron Waiting for Someone to 'Step Up' and Ask Her Out</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Seth Blocked?</h2><p>The comedic actor has discovered various celebrities are blocking him on social media. Recently, he opened up about Larry the Cable Guy giving him the old Twitter block, and now it's <strong><a href=#>Rob Schneider</a></strong>.</p><p>"I've been blocked by a lot of random weird celebrities," Rogen said. "I find out when one of them tweets something stupid and everyone I follow is retweeting it and I try to follow the thing and then I realize I'm blocked."</p><p>"I have no f--king clue why," he told Andy. "It's a good reverse psychology thing because I couldn't give a shit what Rob Schneider is tweeting until he blocked me. And then I'm like, what is this guy saying? Must be fascinating."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:3468447f-95d1-50ec-8a8a-76e1b2bfb3c4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2487b7fd-b3c1-5af1-92cd-e0a627fd0b9f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f7/5by4/2019/05/02/f707b82e7ddc58bebc3f543fc3c4e6c4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">NBC/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Rihanna Proves She's a Savage with Hilarious Burn Present for Charlize Theron</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>French Kiss?</h2><p>Charlize went viral recently for calling out a French television host when the man abruptly kissed her interpreter without consent. And while it seems perfectly reasonable that she spoke out, she admitted she still has doubts about it.</p><p>She says the reason she did speak out had more to do with the vibe of the whole experience than even that particular incident. "Sometimes you just get a vibe and it's hard to explain that," she tried to explain. "Everything was wrong with that whole situation. It was strange."</p><p>And yet, she immediately had second thoughts about speaking out. "I kind of second-guessed my reaction," she said. "Like maybe I jumped on this guy-- maybe it was innocent."</p><p>But later the interpreter told her the guy asked if she was titillated by the kiss, and that certainly makes it sound pretty lecherous. Nevertheless, Charlize said, "Maybe I shouldn't have said something. I'm sure she could have stood up for herself. I don't know, I just felt bad for her in that moment."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:bb607ddf-d352-5a2d-9c5e-32e2825432f4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2487b7fd-b3c1-5af1-92cd-e0a627fd0b9f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f9/5by4/2019/04/19/f90736ab7b7f5abf8947b287847becb4_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty/Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'Octomom' Nadya Suleman Blames the 'Parasitic' Media for Those Angelina Jolie Plastic Surgery Rumors</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Angelina Beef?</h2><p>Part of the reason Charlize may be so hesitant about her own reactions and responses is because she's found herself on the receiving end of what she basically says are made-up stories in the tabloid media. A perfect example is when Andy asked if the apparent beef between her and <strong><a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a></strong> was real or if the media just make it all up.</p><p>"Oh 100 percent," she quickly said of the media. "I don't know her very well -- I know her from events -- but she's always so lovely. ... We're not friends or hang out, but she's never been nothing but gracious and lovely and warm."</p><p>Seth, on the other hand, was ready to start some beef, joking, "Me and her f--kig hate each other. F--k you, Angelina Jolie!"</p><p>He then immediately regretted his words and apologized, echoing the sentiment that she's only ever been kind and gracious in his experience.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:bf4d8755-009b-5af1-b530-3c48a532a028 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2487b7fd-b3c1-5af1-92cd-e0a627fd0b9f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1f/5by4/2018/12/28/1f71b0432f935eee980284fba2ce56a2_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Everett Collection/Instagram/Walt Disney/Lionsgate</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">19 Remakes and Reboots Coming in 2019 That Actually Look Good</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>Wonder Mom?</h2><p>Charlize got the opportunity to talk about another case of the media kind of putting the wrong spin on a story. She was asked if she had any regrets about turning down <strong><a href=#>"Wonder Woman"</a></strong> considering what a tremendous success it became, and Charlize explained that the situation is not quite what it seemed on the surface.</p><p>"I did not turn the role of Wonder Woman down," she explained. She then asked if she could tell the whole story because it's "a great example of how Hollywood slaps you in the face when you start aging."</p><p>She was approached about the "Wonder Woman" film while it was in development. "Somebody had said to me 'There's action on this thing, 'Wonder Woman,' you should-- We just want to make you aware of it.' I was like, 'Oh, just, I'm not familiar with it. I don't really know-- I mean, what does Wonder Woman do?'"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a75e9c49-45c1-53e1-a558-780e82e6e2d8 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2487b7fd-b3c1-5af1-92cd-e0a627fd0b9f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1b/5by4/2019/03/08/1b06f12910e95d81b8270776b2c97b57_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Warner Bros.</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Early Twitter Reactions to 'Shazam!'

"This person said, 'No, it's for Wonder Woman's mom,'" Charlize said. "It was the defining moment where I was-- like, I crossed over and I wasn't fully aware of it."</p><p>Seth Rogen may not have experienced that, but he was able to come to his friend Jonah Hill's defense over another journalist who wrote an unflattering article about the actor basically being "a jerk" during the filming of "This Is The End."</p><p>"That journalist and Jonah really did not get along and I do remember that was an unfair representation of Jonah," Seth said. "So no, he was not a jerk. That journalist kind of painted him in a poor light, I would say."</p><p>Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen keep the laughs coming together in "Long Shot," in theaters nationwide today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnp7j25maWtfmLWivsuisZ5lpJ2ys7vNZqqerJhiv7CzxKdknaqlnMBurc2gnKWhnpZ6q7vLopxmr5%2Bjsaa%2BjLCmppmeYr%2BwroysmqGmlZ6xpr6MsK6hpF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcharlize-theron-seth-rogen-drugs-angelina-jolie-wonder-woman-rob-schneider-wwhl.html&text=Charlize%20Theron%20and%20Seth%20Rogen%20on%20Taking%20Drugs%2c%20Beefing%20with%20Angelina%20Jolie&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcharlize-theron-seth-rogen-drugs-angelina-jolie-wonder-woman-rob-schneider-wwhl.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcharlize-theron-seth-rogen-drugs-angelina-jolie-wonder-woman-rob-schneider-wwhl.html&title=Charlize%20Theron%20and%20Seth%20Rogen%20on%20Taking%20Drugs%2c%20Beefing%20with%20Angelina%20Jolie" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcharlize-theron-seth-rogen-drugs-angelina-jolie-wonder-woman-rob-schneider-wwhl.html&title=Charlize%20Theron%20and%20Seth%20Rogen%20on%20Taking%20Drugs%2c%20Beefing%20with%20Angelina%20Jolie" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcharlize-theron-seth-rogen-drugs-angelina-jolie-wonder-woman-rob-schneider-wwhl.html&title=Charlize%20Theron%20and%20Seth%20Rogen%20on%20Taking%20Drugs%2c%20Beefing%20with%20Angelina%20Jolie" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcharlize-theron-seth-rogen-drugs-angelina-jolie-wonder-woman-rob-schneider-wwhl.html&description=Charlize%20Theron%20and%20Seth%20Rogen%20on%20Taking%20Drugs%2c%20Beefing%20with%20Angelina%20Jolie" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mercado-fichajes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fichajes 2023 - 2024 - Mercado de fichajes de verano">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jessica-biel-wows-beach-photo-cut-out-swimsuit-celebrating-justin-timberlake.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jessica Biel celebrates Justin Timberlake with splashy beach photo">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
