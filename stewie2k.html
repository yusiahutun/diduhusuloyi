Is Stewie2k dating anyone now?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Stewie2k (real name Jacky Yip) is a professional Counter-Strike: Global Offensive player who was part of Team Liquid.</p><h2><strong>The Origin Story</strong></h2><p>Yip was born on January 7th of 1998.</p><p>While he was raised in San Francisco, California, with his older brother and sister, his parents were often gone on different business trips in China.</p><p>It was through his older brother, Jason, that Yip first found out and picked up Counter-Strike 1.6.</p><p>When describing his childhood, Yip has often mentioned that his parents were not fans of video games and wanted their children to have typical careers such as being a lawyer or a doctor.</p><p>In Yip’s words, they were “stereotypical Asian parents.”</p><p>This caused a rift in the family as Yip continued to game, which brought on his parents’ disapproval.</p><p>In fact, Yip can recall his mother telling him that he was going to be a failure.</p><p>This rift was heightened even further as Yip decided to fly to LA at the age of 17 in order to pursue his gaming career.</p><h2><strong>Counter-Strike</strong></h2><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-43762 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/What-is-the-net-worth-of-Stewie2k.jpg.webp alt="What is the net worth of Stewie2k" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw -

He added: ”They [told] me my mistakes and helped me to be more mature.”</p><p>With Team Liquid, Yip would once again make history.</p><p>At the end of 2019, Stewie2k became the first North American CS: GO player to earn over $1 million in tournament prize money.</p><p>This was after he finished in second place (runner-up to Astralis) in the ECS Season 8 Finals.</p><p>In 2019, he would continue on and win a total of 7 tournaments with Team Liquid, making the earning of Team Liquid’s CS:GO approximately $2.31 million in 2019.</p><p>Yip is a fundamental part of Team Liquids’ success, and he has continued playing with them since then.</p><h2><strong>Evil Geniuses</strong></h2><p>He inked with Evil Geniuses in January 2022.</p><h2><strong>Girlfriend</strong></h2><p>There is no information about Stewie2k’s girlfriend.</p><h2><strong>Quotes</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-32003 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Stewie2k-Net-Worth.jpg.webp alt="Stewie2k Net Worth" width=1200 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Stewie2k-Net-Worth.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-3 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-32003 class=wp-caption-text>© Guliver / Getty Images</p><p>”My favorite teammate of all time has to be FalleN.”</p><p>”For all the people who are an aspiring pro player, you don’t have to take the route I took.”</p><p>”I feel like people know what they need to do when chaotic situations happen.” (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HLTV</a>)</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Kitboga Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Stewie2k – Net Worth & Earnings</strong></h2><p>So, how much is Stewie2k worth?</p><p>Yip earned most of his wealth from participating in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tournaments.
