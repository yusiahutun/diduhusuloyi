They selected the name Luna Simone for their daughter, with her middle name being a tribute to singer and activist Nina Simone. For their son, they chose Miles Theodore after musician Miles Davis.</p><p>"We named our first daughter Luna Simone Stephens, and every name we give to our kids will have a little bit of musical history to it," John said during an interview with <a href=#>E!</a> "Miles is, of course, the same name as the great Miles Davis."</p><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=#><strong>Joel Madden</strong></a><strong> &</strong><a href=#><strong> Nicole Richie</strong></a></p><p>When Joel Madden and Nicole Richie welcomed their first daughter Harlow Winter, they chose a name that took inspiration from two famous faces. Joel says the little girl's first name came from actress Jean Harlow and model Shalom Harlow.</p><p>"I really like Jean Harlow the actress, and [Nicole] likes Shalom Harlow the model. Harlow's cool because it feels like a classic name.

He added that they also appreciated that it was an old English name.</p><p>"Victoria's favorite book is 'To Kill A Mockingbird' and it's a very strong, passionate book and the author was Harper Lee, and that is where Harper came from," he explained in a <a href=#>Facebook video</a>.</p><p><strong>4. </strong><a href=#><strong>Beyoncé</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Jay-Z</strong></a></p><p>Beyoncé and Jay-Z were inspired by their favorite poet when they welcomed their daughter Rumi, choosing to name the little girl after the famed 13th-century Persian poet of the same name.</p><p>"Rumi is our favorite poet, so it was for our daughter," Jay-Z said in an interview with "<a href=#>Rap Radar</a>."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:4576dc56-1584-4d6a-9d2d-8ab45774e28c data-container-ref=toofab:article:683dc071-2c21-4d87-a6d6-ce1f3361d0ca data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/63/5by4/2022/08/11/635bbda37aa24ab6836345d3a748449d_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">9 Musicians Who Had to Change Their Offensive Song Lyrics</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>5. </strong><a href=#><strong>Fergie</strong></a><strong> &</strong><a href=#><strong> Josh Duhamel</strong></a></p><p>Before their split, Fergie and Josh Duhamel welcomed a son named Axl. While the former couple has never confirmed it, sources close to Fergie say that it was definitely a nod to one of her favorite bands, Guns ‘N Roses.</p><p>"Fergie is a huge Guns 'N Roses fan -- one of her career highlights has been performing and recording with Slash -- so Axl makes perfect sense," a source told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>.</p><p><strong>6. </strong><a href=#><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong></a><strong> & </strong><a href=#><strong>Keith Urban</strong></a></p><p>Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban paid tribute to Australian patron of the arts Sunday Reed when they named their little girl Sunday Rose. Nicole says the name was first suggested by her father and she fell in love with it because it was also her favorite day of the week.</p><p>"We went, 'Oh, we love that day' -- that's our favorite day because I think there's something to do with Sundays where if you're lonely, Sundays are a very lonely day.

Helena says they considered other famous musicians but thought Mingus was the best fit.</p><p>"His father especially is into Charlie Mingus. I was more into Thelonious Monk, Chet Baker, Billie Holiday -- but we thought 'Mingus' sounded cooler than 'Monk' for a first name," she told <a href=#>The Independent</a>.</p><p><strong>8. </strong><a href=#><strong>Amy Schumer</strong></a></p><p>When Amy Schumer named her son, she originally intended to pay tribute to her friend, comedian Dave Attell. She gave the little boy the name Gene Attell but her mom quickly pointed out that the names combined sounded like something inappropriate. In the end, Amy chose to change Gene's middle name to David, keeping the nod to her friend.</p><p>"So do you guys know that Gene, our baby's name, is officially changed? It's now Gene David Fischer. It was Gene Attell Fischer, but we realized that we, by accident, named our son 'genital.' Gene Attell sounds like genital," Amy said on her podcast "<a href=#>Amy Schumer Presents 3 Girls, 1 Keith</a>."</p><p><strong>9. </strong><a href=#><strong>Cate Blanchett</strong></a></p><p>Cate Blanchett admits she has had some unusual inspiration for her children's names but when it came to her son Dashiell, she had literature in mind. The actress <a href=#>says</a> she named her son after author Dashiell Hammett. Her son Ignatius also has a literary-inspired name, although his moniker comes from a name in the "Captain Underpants" book series.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0c6a6977-ac33-4664-8126-040808ca4ff7 data-container-ref=toofab:article:683dc071-2c21-4d87-a6d6-ce1f3361d0ca data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/af/5by4/2020/05/18/afc95b2301d64b85b4aab6024937f06e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">25 Celebrities Who Decided to Change Their Name</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>10. </strong><a href=#><strong>Mindy Kaling</strong></a></p><p>Mindy Kaling had old Hollywood in mind when she was naming her children. For her daughter Katherine, she paid tribute to the "incredible" Katharine Hepburn and for her son Spencer, she says she was inspired by Spencer Tracy.</p><p>"I don't trust my own judgment with those kinds of names. If I name my son River, that connotes a certain kind of person who is very go with the flow, artsy. But what if he's not like that at all? Will he be furious with me? I just tried to pick classic names that felt like they would have to work really hard to get mad at me about later," Mindy told <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p><strong>11.</strong><a href=#><strong> Alyssa Milano</strong></a></p><p>Alyssa Milano paid tribute to her friend Milo Ventimiglia when she was naming her son Milo. She says that on top of liking the name, the actor was partially responsible for matching her up with her husband David Bugliari. Alyssa explained that when she was unsure about dating David because he worked at her agency, Milo encouraged her to do it.</p><p>"I loved that name, but when Milo was born, he just looked like a Milo to me and I thought it would be a lovely homage to Milo Ventimiglia for encouraging me to find my love," Alyssa shared with <a href=#>People</a>.</p><a id=gallery-link-2ac3f5d0-65a3-5edc-b4c9-c1340c98f409 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:2ac3f5d0-65a3-5edc-b4c9-c1340c98f409 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:683dc071-2c21-4d87-a6d6-ce1f3361d0ca data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3e/4by3/2017/06/28/3edc7370ae5d5f30be21e99f5e175fec_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Instagram</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGlma3FfZn5ur8SlnJuqmanGbrfInapmr5ikerix0Z5kp5mdmrFurcWtnKtln6m1pr6Mn5imp6WoerGxzqmjnmc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f11-celebrity-kids-who-were-named-after-other-famous-people.html&text=11%20Celebrity%20Kids%20Who%20Were%20Named%20After%20Other%20Famous%20People&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f11-celebrity-kids-who-were-named-after-other-famous-people.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f11-celebrity-kids-who-were-named-after-other-famous-people.html&title=11%20Celebrity%20Kids%20Who%20Were%20Named%20After%20Other%20Famous%20People" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f11-celebrity-kids-who-were-named-after-other-famous-people.html&title=11%20Celebrity%20Kids%20Who%20Were%20Named%20After%20Other%20Famous%20People" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f11-celebrity-kids-who-were-named-after-other-famous-people.html&title=11%20Celebrity%20Kids%20Who%20Were%20Named%20After%20Other%20Famous%20People" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f11-celebrity-kids-who-were-named-after-other-famous-people.html&description=11%20Celebrity%20Kids%20Who%20Were%20Named%20After%20Other%20Famous%20People" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lexa-doig-and-michael-shanks.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lexa Doig and Michael Shanks">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./vestidos-de-novia-bonitos-alta-costura-mejor-inspiracion-todas-edades.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vestidos de novia bonitos inspirados en la Alta Costura">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
