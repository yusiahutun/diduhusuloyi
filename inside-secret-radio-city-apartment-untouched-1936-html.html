It was forgotten after he died in 1936 but is now a private event space for A-listers</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Tucked within Radio City Music Hall is a secret apartment that has been almost untouched since 1936.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With its gold leaf ceilings, marble, custom-made wooden furniture crafted in the early 1930s, shower with 12 jets, it is an incredible insight into how the other half lived at a time when America was in the grip of the Great Depression.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Originally a two-story private space in the eaves of Radio City, it was an office and entertaining area with a bedroom and bathroom bestowed upon theater impresario Samuel ‘Roxy’ Rothafel by the Rockefeller family in 1932.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The opulence of the space was entirely befitting of its occupant. ‘Roxy’ was the man they had charged with bringing his signature glitz and glamour to Radio City – the same glam and success he’d brought to his own theater The Roxy on 50th Avenue and Broadway. His name was synonymous with theatrical success.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After his death, the apartment lay forgotten and abandoned.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now, the apartment’s primary function remains what it was intended for during Roxy’s time: a place for the rich and famous to be entertained.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p>© Ben Gancsos for DailyMail.com<p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-larger">The room has still maintained the entirety of its original furniture and fixtures, many of which were custom made to fit the space, such as this mahogany dresser, pictured back center, which was a gift to Roxy from David Sarnoff, a radio and television pioneer at the time. It contained ‘state of the art technology,’ according to tour guide Joyce Hancock, which at the time were items such as record players. The wide-screen television is in the room to provide for the current events held in the room - and Walt Disney can be seen in the center of the black and white photo on the bottom left</p>© Ben Gancsos for DailyMail.com<p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-larger">The wooden panels that span the room are quilted mahogany give way to 20-foot high ceilings that are wall-to-wall gold leaf</p>© Ben Gancsos for DailyMail.com<p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-larger">The room once held the biggest stars of the time for social and business gatherings, such as Walt Disney, pictured center. Today, it has hosted the likes of Mick Jagger, John Legend, Mariah Carey, and Anderson Cooper who have attended opening night after parties in the spacious art deco room</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>A guest book reveals the signatures of some of the best known partygoers – Alfred Hitchcock accompanied his name with a drawing of his silhouetted profile, a nod to his iconic logo; Liberace’s signature is given a little extra glamour with a sketch of a grand piano and Robert Lantz drew a striking photo of the character he was best known for playing – Woody Woodpecker. Cyndi Lauper, Mariah Carey, John Legend, Anderson Cooper, and Tim Russert have also visited.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The planning of Radio City Music Hall began in 1927 in an area of Midtown Manhattan known then as the ‘speakeasy belt’ because it was notoriously gritty and filled with gambling houses.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But two years later in October 1929, the stock market crashed sending Wall Street into a panicked frenzy and causing a ripple effect that brought the Great Depression. It’s estimated that by 1933, some 15 million Americans were unemployed and half the banks had failed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Despite the hardships, J.D Rockefeller was motivated to press on with building to create something beautiful from the rubble of the stock market crash, and began building in 1930.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His hope was that Rockefeller Center – and Radio City Music Hall – would be a beacon of architectural and recreational success that could attract visitors, and investors. He reasoned that the world needed glamour and entertainment now more than ever.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>By the time it was finished, the Rockefeller Plaza complex, of which Radio City is part, had cost $250million - more than $3.5billion in today’s money. 75,000 men had worked on the development. Radio City was opened in 1932 - and the entirety of Rockefeller Center was opened in 1933.</p>© Ben Gancsos for DailyMail.com<p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-larger">The planning of Radio City Music Hall began in 1927 in an area of Midtown Manhattan known then as the ‘speakeasy belt’ because it was notoriously gritty and filled with gambling houses</p>© Ben Gancsos for DailyMail.com<p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-larger">When the stock market crashed in 1929, JD Rockefeller decided to press on with building of Radio City Hall and the surrounding Rockefeller Plaza in 1930 in the hopes of creating something so beautiful that it would stimulate investors and visitors</p>© Ben Gancsos for DailyMail.com<p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-larger">The left-hand black and white picture shown here in the right-hand photo are actress Judy Garland and Radio City producer Leon Leonidoff in 1941</p>© Ben Gancsos for DailyMail.com<p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-larger">Roxy Rothafel was credited with creating the design theme of Radio City, which he got the inspiration from after returning from a European trip on a cruise ship and watching the sun set across the water</p>© Ben Gancsos for DailyMail.com<p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-larger">By the time it was finished, the Radio City part of the Rockefeller Plaza complex had cost $250million - more than $3.5billion in today’s money. 75,000 men had worked on the development until the Plaza was opened in 1932</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The most undeniably striking quality is the 20ft high ceiling, gold leafed wall to wall.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Even on a foggy day, light streams in through the frosted glass windows, illuminating the otherwise brooding art deco interior design of rich mahogany woods and burnt orange leather chairs.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The wooden panels that span the room are quilted mahogany, and on them are hung a vast circular mirror which faces the also spherical dining room in the back.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The dining room itself is an architectural feat. It was constructed as a perfect dome, so that the acoustics would be suited for Roxy’s guests to have conversation over the sound of ongoing shows at the theater. And entertain he did. When he was manager at Radio City Music Hall until 1934, Roxy used the area for business and pleasure, dining amongst the likes of Walt Disney and Judy Garland. The room can now be rented for private events, and is primarily used for opening night after-parties at Radio City.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The room was crafted by the in-house interior designer for Radio City, Donald Deskey, who won the position in a fierce competition between four other designers. He spent his last $5,000 on a detailed portfolio of his vision for Radio City, and eventually, it was his dramatic art deco flair that caught the attention of Roxy and Rockefeller, who felt his style would remain modern for decades to come.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Today when the room is rented out, the in-house Radio City event planner is contracted to decorate it however they see fit. One notable host was Mick Jagger, who decided to adorn the room with Ikea furniture for an event he once held there.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>America’s Got Talent also partnered with the room and transformed it many times to portray the aesthetic of famous American brands such as Dunkin Donuts, Reddi-Whip and Orville Redenbacher.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font></p>© NBC via Getty Images<p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-larger">Rothafel, pictured center, is seen here with other NBC Executives aboard the S.S.
