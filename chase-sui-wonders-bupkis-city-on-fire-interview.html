But when the actress patches into our call from New York, she is cool and lively, as if I’m catching her after a restful nap rather than post-junket. It’s been a whirlwind month for the 26-year-old Michigan native, who is hot off the release of Bupkis, Pete Davidson’s semi-autobiographical Peacock comedy series, in which she portrays his on-screen girlfriend. In case that weren’t hectic enough, we spoke just hours before the premiere of City on Fire, a drama series based on the novel by Garth Risk Hallberg, which untangles a web of mysteries connected to the murder of her character, Sam.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For many years, the spotlight didn’t seem like it was in the cards for Wonders, who was plagued with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-us/porter/article-558730e96ea87ed7/incredible-women/incredible-women/chase-sui-wonders data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="selective mutism" data-vars-ga-product-id=5c670e54-549c-42b3-9617-9f7c93321898 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-us/porter/article-558730e96ea87ed7/incredible-women/incredible-women/chase-sui-wonders data-product-url=https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-us/porter/article-558730e96ea87ed7/incredible-women/incredible-women/chase-sui-wonders data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2Fen-us%2Fporter%2Farticle-558730e96ea87ed7%2Fincredible-women%2Fincredible-women%2Fchase-sui-wonders" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-brand=net-a-porter.com data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=4adf8909-9efb-4b43-9814-da412c39e6cc data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=net-a-porter.com class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090"><u>selective mutism</u></a> as a child, which she remedied with years and years of community theater. But when the actress broke through on the Lena Dunham–produced HBO Max series <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a36982376/chase-sui-wonders-interview/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Generation class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>Generation</u></a> as budding photographer Riley, all bets were off. Wonders has also delighted fans new and old in Sofia Coppola’s 2020 film On the Rocks and as good-girl actress Emma in the 2022 horror comedy Bodies Bodies Bodies, in which she starred alongside Amandla Stenberg, Rachel Sennott, Myha’la Herrold, and Maria Bakalova. Now she’s reached a turning point in her career as City on Fire’s leading lady and among another roster of impressive costars on Bupkis.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below, Wonders talks to BAZAAR about how she made her way back to acting after overcoming her crippling shyness, subverting the “manic pixie dream girl” archetype, and the movie she’s trying to manifest.<br></p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>I read that when you did theater your first year at Harvard, you were put off by a bad review by a fellow student. What made you want to get back into performing again?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That was so scarring. I was in musical theater growing up, and I was always chorus, so it just felt like this familiar shame. One time in community theater, I got one line during one rehearsal and then like the next rehearsal, the director was like, “Hey, who wants this one line?” And I was like, “Wait, you gave that to me last week! I have the one line!” It was that familiar feeling. It was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I was like, “Yep, I’m out.” But I think because I studied film, and because I was writing and directing my own stuff, it just felt natural to try to act out characters as a way to help my writing. It felt like another entry point to creating stories. I wasn’t giving up for good!</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Do you have a favorite play that you did when you were in school?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s funny, I always tried to be in these plays and I would always be chorus. But my last year, they were putting on this play called Curiosity Cat. That was the senior play, and that was the year the drama teacher was like, “I see something, some dim light of potential. Maybe I should make you the lead!” It just sucked because it’s a play about a cat. Imagine the movie Cats but done infinitely worse. After the play, the director came up to me and he was like, “I’ve gotta tell you, I’m sorry. I picked the play before I saw the potential in you and knew that you would have been halfway good. I should have picked a different vessel for your debut.”</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Oh my god. That’s so bad. I think </strong><strong>Cats</strong><strong> in general is already on shaky ground and then add high school theater to the mix…</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You’re alienating a lot of your audience.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You previously worked with Pete Davidson on </strong><strong>Bodies Bodies Bodies</strong><strong>, where you played a couple, Emma and David, and now on </strong><strong>Bupkis</strong><strong> you’re playing Nikki, his on-again, off-again girlfriend. How did you approach playing two different couples?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s always some reality between art and life. From Bodies, Pete and I got along really well and we worked super well together. I think we just brought that same energy into this show and this relationship. All my friends who are also actors, we have a million different thoughts about different ways we can play friends or love interests, or brother and sister. I think that’s the beauty of being close to someone and seeing so many sides of someone.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Do you have a way of differentiating between your work and your life? How do you leave it at the door when you leave set?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think early days on my first meaty job, Generation, I was not ready for the mental backflips that your brain has to do. But since then I feel like I’ve done a much better job at separating it. I don’t really conflate the two anymore—I think that gets really messy and so confusing and unnecessarily torturous. I know some actors who feel like it’s fun to slip into it. And sometimes it is, as long as you’re conscious of the fact that you’re slipping into the deep end. But there are these things called closure tactics that this intimacy coordinator taught me on Generation, and it’s a way of on-ramping and off-ramping at the end of the day, especially when it’s an emotionally draining day. It’s kind of meditative—you check into your body or check out of your body through different senses, like taking a cold shower or smelling citrus. Sensory stuff like that cues your brain subliminally that what’s happening is not real.</p><img alt="chase sui wonders" title="chase sui wonders" width=3179 height=2376 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/30130033-edited-6464ea976c5b3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Jeannie Sui Wonders</span></p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>I really was struck by your chemistry with Pete, particularly in the scene in Bupkis in the car when Pete is about to go to rehab, and you’re having this serious talk, but you’re still fucking with each other a little bit.</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I love that scene so much. He is an expert at bringing authenticity to his work. In that scene, those characters are just two people who have so much love for each other and also are trying to make light of a really grim moment. In situations like that, the best thing you can do, or sometimes, the only thing you can do, is laugh about it, and try to undercut it and deflect from it. I think that scene is an example of two people who just can’t love each other in the right way at a certain time, and I think that’s why it's so painful and heartbreaking. But yeah, I mean, that’s all a testament to the writers and creators and Pete, who crafted that episode so well.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>I also really loved the scene before, where you guys go dancing. It was so clunky, but very clearly intentional. Was it choreographed?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yeah, it was actually. We did so many lessons. It’s so disorienting. That’s part of the charm of Bupkis—you’re in Miami and Simon Rex is there, but then suddenly we’re on the dance floor, twirling around, having the most serious conversation ever. But yeah, we practiced for that, and it didn’t get us far.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>How long did you practice?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We had three lessons total. That’s the first take because we’re like, “This is so embarrassing. We can only do this so many times.”</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You’re also starring in </strong><strong>City on Fire. </strong><strong>What was it like for you to switch gears and be in a mystery?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s a totally different style. Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage are masters. I grew up just watching The OC and Gossip Girl on loop. Those characters were like all my best friends, and they all kept me company. Working on a show with them, there’s just so much trust and there’s no room for improv. You try to fudge up the lines and stuff and make it your own, and you’re like, “Ah, but what they wrote is better.” They have such a lock on the story. [My character Sam] reminded me a lot of Laura Palmer in Twin Peaks. You know, these doomed ladies like Penny Lane in Almost Famous and Angelina Jolie in Girl, Interrupted and Kate Winslet in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Knowing what happens to Sam—she gets shot in Central Park, and it’s told through all these flashbacks—it’s just fun to play that element of a girl living fast and attracting all this chaos into her life, and then it ends up getting her into trouble.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Lately, there’s been this really interesting shift on TV, like with </strong><strong>Poker Face </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>City on Fire</strong><strong>, giving this dimension to these characters whose fates we already know going in. How did you approach Sam knowing from the start that she was doomed?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I went in with that consciousness of America being so obsessed with finding the missing girl, and all the lore that surrounds all these girls who go missing. I always found that super icky, this fascination, almost fetish. But not only do Josh and Stephanie transcend that stereotype completely, they treat it so well. Sam never feels like the victim. She is a central player in all this stuff and happens to be caught in the middle. She’s so active. She’s not caught in the wrong place at the wrong time—I mean, she is, but she puts herself there. That’s the key difference. She’s an agent of chaos. She is the one acting, and that’s what gets her in trouble. It instantly changes the dynamic.</p><img alt="chase sui wonders" title="chase sui wonders" width=1920 height=1280 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/city-on-fire-photo-010302-6464ebe9d224f.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Apple</span><p>Wonders in City on Fire</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You’ve named all these well-written characters who have still been labeled manic pixie dream girls. How did you approach the role to ensure that you’re providing that depth?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I think those are great versions of that archetype, and then there are one-dimensional versions that don’t feel lived in. It’s the writing that helps transcend that. It’s bringing in real experiences and real feelings. It’s not just blind confidence, it’s not just blind charm. It’s confidence mixed with supreme loneliness and this charm as a way to deflect from your own problems. It’s vim and vigor as a response to pain; it’s couching all these “pick-me girl” qualities.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What do you want people to know about you that they may not know already?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I play hockey. Do people know that? I feel like I tell everyone. Literally my passion. I’m trying to manifest a hockey movie.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What’s your team?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Detroit Red Wings, baby!
