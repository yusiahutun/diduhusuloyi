However, recently the Hotline Bling rapper has been more open with his fans when it comes to little Adonis. Drake’s mom, Sandi Graham, also features in the snap. The two have a strong bond, with Drake often celebrating her in his lyrics.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-drake-shares-loving-christmas-snap-with-his-son>Drake shares loving Christmas snap with his son</h2><p>The 37-year-old took to his <a href=#>Instagram</a> with a sweet picture of the trio grinning for the camera in front of their Christmas tree. They looked cozy as Adonis wore black and white loungewear, Sandi sported a black velour matching tracksuit set, and Drake donned a white Nike Air jumper and light blue denim jeans.</p><p>Drake’s jumper seems to have been customized by his youngster as it has drawings on the front, including two stick figures and a Christmas tree. He finished off the look with a gold love heart necklace</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> captioned the post: “Gifted you things with and without barcodes, gave with every fiber of my soul, Gia stones that glowed and Chanel flaps that overflowed. I even gave you the tools to avoid reaping what you sowed…but somehow different stories are being told on road.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Ariana Grande and Ethan Slater ‘take next big step’ in blossoming relationship</a></p><p>People were quick to praise the family underneath the snap, with many wishing Drake, his son, and his mom a merry Christmas.</p><p>“Ngl gonna need Adonis to customize my ball kicks for next game [artist palette emoji],” wrote one person.</p><p>Another penned: “Merry Christmas to you and your beautiful family,” with a Christmas tree and fingers crossed emoji.</p><p>“Awww Merry Christmas to you and yours,” said a third, adding a Christmas tree, present, and yellow heart emoji.</p><p>A fourth commented: “Sandi’s looking good. Happy holidays.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-has-drake-said-about-his-son>What has Drake said about his son?</h2><p>Adonis recently dropped his debut single at the age of six called My Man Freestyle but, before then, the child remained largely out of the spotlight. Drake didn’t even tell fans about his son until a year after he was born, and no pictures of Adonis were posted until 2020.</p><p>On parenting, Drake told HBO’s The Shop: “We have found ourselves in a situation and we are both equally responsible. Now, I’m just really excited to be a great father.”</p><p>He further explained to Lil Wayne on his radio show on Young Money Radio with Lil Wayne he didn’t want those around him to feel like they had to hide because of who he was. &nbsp;“I don’t want to feel like just because of a life choice I made to be a ‘celebrity’ that I got to make everybody live under this blanket … I just wanted to free myself of that.”</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href=#>7 celebrity breakups that shattered our belief in Happily Ever Afters in 2023</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpqX2eFcLDRmqKeZaOdrrOx0mapmqqVYr2qr9OuqZ5lp57BqXnSqKVmrJ9isKa4xJupmqyVYsGpsYyhpqWhlJbGtHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdrake-shares-rare-picture-with-son-to-celebrate-the-holidays.html&text=Drake%20shares%20rare%20picture%20with%20son%20to%20celebrate%20the%20holidays&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdrake-shares-rare-picture-with-son-to-celebrate-the-holidays.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdrake-shares-rare-picture-with-son-to-celebrate-the-holidays.html&title=Drake%20shares%20rare%20picture%20with%20son%20to%20celebrate%20the%20holidays" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdrake-shares-rare-picture-with-son-to-celebrate-the-holidays.html&title=Drake%20shares%20rare%20picture%20with%20son%20to%20celebrate%20the%20holidays" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdrake-shares-rare-picture-with-son-to-celebrate-the-holidays.html&title=Drake%20shares%20rare%20picture%20with%20son%20to%20celebrate%20the%20holidays" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdrake-shares-rare-picture-with-son-to-celebrate-the-holidays.html&description=Drake%20shares%20rare%20picture%20with%20son%20to%20celebrate%20the%20holidays" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./princess-sofia-of-sweden-best-fashion-moments.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Princess Sofia of Sweden's best fashion moments of all time">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./gary-motykie-4034415.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Gary Motykie dating?
