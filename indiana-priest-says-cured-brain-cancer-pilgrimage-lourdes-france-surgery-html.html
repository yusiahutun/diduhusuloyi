'So I made the video mostly for the victim survivors of Catholic clergy sexual abuse, just to let them know that I had been healed.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He says that while he was willing to make the sacrifice, he claims he realized that God used his suffering to help him the most.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'When the scandals of 2018 broke out, most of you know that they have affected me deeply, as they have most of the church,' Hollowell wrote in a blog following his diagnosis.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I prayed in 2018 that if there was some suffering I could undertake on behalf of all the victims, some cross I could carry, I would welcome that. I feel like this is that cross, and I embrace it willingly,' he stated.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He also notes that the anniversary of his diagnosis, February 11th, is also the anniversary of the first apparition of Our Lady of Lourdes to St. Bernadette Soubirous -&nbsp;a French nun who lived in the 1800s whose visions of the Virgin Mary ultimately led to the founding of the shrine of Lourdes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I just wanted to make a video really quickly to let everybody know that I actually was healed of my brain tumor in Lourdes,'&nbsp;Hollowell stated. 'I had a pretty negative MRI about two-and-a-half months before I left for Lourdes.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'The MRI showed that [the tumor] was starting to grow back … The MRI that I had also had found a tumor on my pituitary gland, as well,' he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Like Naaman the Syrian in our first reading, who washed and was cleansed from leprosy in the Jordan, I washed in the river at Lourdes and was cured and like the leper who returns to give thanks, I want to publicly thank Jesus for healing me,' he wrote.</p><img id=i-a1dfb6a868c54afc src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/02/04/05/67314343-11712385-image-a-47_1675487881857.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Lourdes is a well-known pilgrimage site for many believers and has had 70 healings recognized as miraculous by the Catholic Church" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Lourdes is a well-known pilgrimage site for many believers and has had 70 healings recognized as miraculous by the Catholic Church</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I want to thank Jesus for the gift not just of my healing but also the gift of the tumor surgeries, radiation and chemo as well.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'Almost nothing in my life is the same since my surgeries, radiation and chemo,' he also wrote, 'and I have realized that all those differences in my life since the surgeries, radiation and chemo have been blessings.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hollowell says&nbsp;his cognitive ability also improved following his trip to France.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I felt a lot stronger when I got back from Lourdes. Friends, family and parishioners told me that I looked a lot healthier,' he told <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Fox News.</a>&nbsp;'When I got back from Lourdes, I could preach without a prepared text again.' he explained, noting how he had been relying on written passages before his pilgrimage.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I was OK if I died — I was willing to make the sacrifice for victims of Catholic clergy abuse. But I thought, 'Well, if I go to Lourdes, and I'm healed there, then that might have an impact on some of my fallen-away family and friends,'' he said on video.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr. Marc Siegel, a professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center is not altogether surprised at his good news given that Hollowell had a 74 percent five-year survival rate.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I believe in the power of prayer, and I believe in miracle cures and I believe in Lourdes but with this particular tumor, there is about a 74% five-year survival rate, depending on what grade it is,' Dr. Siegel explained.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'And Hollowell had surgery and chemotherapy, so it's not surprising to me that the tumor is gone.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Siegel also said that he did not have 'the most severe of all brain tumors,' and that it&nbsp;'could be cured.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I don't think it's all Lourdes in this case. But I do think doctors have the hands of God — that's a well-known saying.
