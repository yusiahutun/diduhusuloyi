The statuesque actor - he's 6ft 3in tall - is one of those performers to whom the word "smouldering" is applied with telling regularity. And the enigmatic restraint often displayed by his onscreen characters could be seen as reflecting the progress of his career a journey that has been more leisurely stroll than lively sprint.</p><p id=e4mlTDwpsayM data-wc=55>The British actor first caught Tinseltown's attention in the indie hit <i>Croupier.</i> Despite initially not making an impact at the box office, its leading man's performance contributed significantly to the film's popularity. Indeed many experts say it could have led to Clive's first Oscar nomination, had the movie not been ruled ineligible on a technicality.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_P4-Foj-5M data-wc=51>In a remarkable testament to the performer's talent and charisma such a buzz grew around <i>Croupier</i> that studio bosses decided to re-release it. Movie critics responded by declaring the then 34-year-old was the next big thing. Clive had long before learned to ignore the excited predictions of an over-enthusiastic press, however.&nbsp;</p><h2>His career</h2><p id=etqZRnBnADz data-wc=97>He had found himself on the receiving end of similar hype eight years earlier when he played obnoxious City boy Stephen Crane in the TV series <i>Chancer</i>. Plaudits came his way again a few years later for the acclaimed incest drama <i>Close My Eyes</i>, but the movie also provoked enough controversy to keep A-list status just beyond his reach. His decision to play a gay concentration camp prisoner in <i>Bent,</i> before taking on the role of a bisexual in a stage production of Noel Coward's <i>Design For Living,</i> further fuelled reservations in the minds of casting agents.&nbsp;</p><p id=e3tYv1OZJ2x data-wc=74>The inconsistent performance of his movies can't have helped much either - <i>Gosford Park</i> and <i>The Bourne Identity</i> both set the industry alight, while <i>Beyond Borders</i> and <i>King Arthur</i> bombed in no uncertain terms. When asked about his erratic relationship with the movie-going public, the actor responds with the same dry indifference one might expect from <i>Croupier</i>'s Jack. "Nobody goes to see <i>Beyond Borders</i> or whatever? Well that's out of my hands," he says.&nbsp;</p><p id=eL6F0Bt3YMv data-wc=80>"The fact is, I would jump at it today with the same appetite, because my gut tells me more than ever that it's not about making career movies or movies that look good. The most important thing is to do the work that you want to do that's how you grow as an actor." The remark would not surprise those who know him. Because although Hollywood has been seduced by Clive Owen, Clive Owen has not fallen head-over-heels for Hollywood.&nbsp;</p><p id=eCjzPNB5AO data-wc=96>His dispassionate approach may stem from the fact that Clive knows a thing or two about life's hardships. In the tradition of <a aria-label="Biography of Michael Caine" class=hm-link href=#>Michael Caine</a> and Gary Oldman, he was born - on October 3, 1964 into a working class household. His father, a Country and Western singer, moved out when Clive was a toddler, leaving him and his three brothers to be raised by mum Pamela. The handsome youngster attended a Coventry comprehensive before being accepted by the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where he would cut his thespian teeth in a series of Shakespearian roles.&nbsp;</p><h2>His personal life</h2><p id=eJv7dop1esz data-wc=79>In 1988 he joined the Young Vic Theatre Company and landed the lead in one of the Bard's most famous works. Playing Romeo would prove a life-changing experience for the then 24-year-old who found himself falling in love with his Juliet - Sarah-Jane Fenton. They married in 1995 and went on to have two daughters, Hannah and Eve. From theatre he turned back to TV and the silver screen, with the potential of true recognition constantly close but elusive.&nbsp;</p><p id=eoDYHSVu0l data-wc=89>A 2005 Oscar nomination for best supporting actor finally made Hollywood sit up and listen. His role in <i>Closer</i>, which also won him a BAFTA award, put him on the A-list map and earned him praise from some of the industry's biggest players. "He's very, very powerful," says his <i>Closer</i> co-star <a aria-label="Biography of Julia Roberts" class=hm-link href=#>Julia Roberts</a>. "I can't wait for everyone to figure out how versatile he is." George Clooney likewise thought he was "the big find", a movie star with a "sexuality and a masculinity that I think is really interesting".&nbsp;</p><p id=epTanYuzeGk data-wc=84>Clive followed up with box office hits <i>Sin City</i>, <i>Derailed</i>, <i>Inside Man</i> and the lead in futuristic thriller <i>Children Of Men</i>. Despite his ever-increasing profile, which in 2007 included an ad campaign as the face of Lancome's men's range, he prefers to steer from of the limelight whenever possible. "My life is divided between work and my family. I don't do anything else," he says. "For me it's all about the work, and when I'm not working, I just hole up with the family."</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_lag0e70>More Profiles:</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9ycV%2BYuarCxGamsJ2eZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f2009100899.html&text=Clive%20Owen%20-%20Biography&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2009100899.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2009100899.html&title=Clive%20Owen%20-%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f2009100899.html&title=Clive%20Owen%20-%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f2009100899.html&title=Clive%20Owen%20-%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2009100899.html&description=Clive%20Owen%20-%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-art-and-science-of-event-videography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Event Videography: The Art and Science of Capturing Time">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./antiques-roadshow-expert-thrilled-guests-29617487.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Antiques Roadshow expert thrilled by guest's family archive linked to 1966 World Cup">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
