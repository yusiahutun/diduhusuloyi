However, we are committed to seeing you look smart and attractive with our different hairstyles suggestions.</p><h2>Best black men hairstyles</h2><h3>1. High top fade</h3><p class=align-left>The high top fade is among the most famous men hairstyles for black men. The 1990’s kids fondly referred this style to as the box thanks to its fade. Preferably, this style is suitable for those people who love keeping voluminous hair.

Afro Fade</h3><p class=align-left>Afro fade is among the common black male youth hairstyles, and it is widely associated with celebrities in Kenya and the world at large. To most people, the Afro fade is a slight modification of the Box hairstyle. The hairstyle requires little maintenance, and unlike the box, the top section of your hair is left to grow. You can also play with this style by adding dye to achieve that conspicuous modern urban look.</p><p class=align-left>Its unique trait is that the hairstyle allows you to flaunt your rich afro. However, this does not imply that the hair should be unkempt. You can shape the faded sides to achieve the perfect fade. The other styling options include the skin bald, low or high fade, all of which make an Afro fade an ideal hairstyle for black men.</p><h3>3. Wave</h3><p class=align-left>As its name suggests, the wave is a type of short hairstyles for black men that involves the barber giving you uniform wave cuts. This black man hairstyle is still trendy mostly among the youth and individuals in the informal sector. While the wave is an interesting and exciting hairstyle, it is only suitable with certain hair types.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/400ed8f04b366e97.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 best braided wigs hairstyles, designs, and ideas in 2021</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Its also quite expensive to maintain as it requires additional hair products for maintenance. Before getting this haircut, make sure you have first consulted with your barber and ascertain that the hairstyle is a perfect match for your hair type. Also, choose a wave hairstyle appropriate with the shape of your head.</p><h3>4. Buzz cut</h3><p class=align-left>Idealistically the buzz haircut is the most preferred black men hairstyles for short hair. Not only is this style manageable with little maintenance cost but also convenient for the formal events and even sporting activities. As simple as it sounds, the buzz cut hairstyle has a way of making one look sophisticated and sharp if not intelligent. Most presidents have had buzz cut as their hair cut style of choice, right from our very own president, Uhuru Kenyatta to Barrack Obama.</p><p class=align-left>Ordinary Kenyans also rock this hairstyle, because of its simplicity, ease of maintenance, and its classy look. Like most haircuts, getting the best buzz cut depends on your choice of a barber; should be one with skills, right shaving equipment and of course knowledge on different shades of a buzz cut. By doing this, you will guarantee you get a clean, short and smart haircut that will make you stand out in any crowd.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/994909ab7614347b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20+ Ghana weaving styles for oval face</span></p></a><h3>5. Frohawk</h3><p class=align-left>Mohawks were a thing sometime back in the days, right? While this exciting hairstyle seems not to be the trend now as much as before, there are fantastic ways to style your hair for the lovers of the Mohawk style. One of these is the Frohawk style.</p><p class=align-left>From a distant, this style would be mistaken for a Mohawk thanks to its close resemblance. Interestingly, the Frohawk haircut can accommodate curly hairstyles for black men with curly hair texture. Find different shades of Frohawk for your head and face shape. Also, finding a good barber will increase your chances of getting the perfect frohawk haircut without fearing for your image.</p><h3>6. Twist with fade</h3><p class=align-left>In a world where people laud creativity and innovation, staying trendy can be a bit difficult. However, this is not applicable with the twist with fade hairstyle, as is the case for many black male urban hairstyles. Yes, fade is a typical style among the black men crowd, with each wearing a different shade of fade. Twist with fade has a characteristic appearance that makes it stand out in a long list of fade styles.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e2ef86edb0d61104.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30+ best sisterlocks hairstyles designs and ideas to try</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Characterized by twisted hair atop the head and a tapering fade beginning slightly above mid head, gradually decreasing as it tends towards the bottom; both on the sides and the back of the head. Complete the style with a cut on your front hairline that will define your forehead and give your head and face a distinctive but sophisticated look.</p><p class=align-left>To get a perfect twist with fade, you have to ensure the hair on top of your head is not less than 2 to 4 inches in height. Most importantly, you have to ensure you get a barber with the right skills and understands your head quite well; it will save you a lot of disappointments.</p><h3>7. Retro haircut</h3><p class=align-left>If you are looking for black male hairstyles for long hair, the retro haircut is your ideal option. This vintage hairstyle has found a place in the modern world. The retro haircut looks good on anyone daring enough to wear it since it utilizes different shades of the fade. A long and neat hair, on top of the head, gradually rising in length from the back of your head to the front where it is the longest, characterizes this classic look.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/6ae6aefc19bc97c4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Karen haircut: What is it and why should you avoid it?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You can argue that the Retro haircut looks like an upgraded afro. The retro hairstyle features a skin fade beginning slightly below the middle of the head. This hairstyle was quite popular in the early hip-hop days with most artists and fans alike, rocking in this original and unique hairstyle. The highlight of this style is the longer hair at the front part of the head, which makes it appealing and attractive. For you to have this look, you have to ensure your hair is long enough, at least 5 inches in height.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/33353c47319fb6a9.jpeg><h3>8. Fade with dreadlocks</h3><p class=align-left>Traditionally, people associated dreadlocks with deviant behavior and rebellion. Now, you can argue for this notion by revisiting the Kenyan history, where freedom fighters wore this hairstyle. Today, however, the world encourages free thinkers and allows different versions of expression. As such, this has created a large enough space, for dreadlocks in the modern black men hairstyles, from short, medium to long dreadlocks. The different lengths of dreadlocks are combined with varying shades of fade.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a1071b05ea4445cc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>11 best Edgar haircuts for men in 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The fade with locs hairstyle, is popular in Kenya, as the latest black men hairstyles for urban dwellers. The haircut features dreadlocks on top of the head and different variations of fades on the sides and the back of the head. You can choose to let your dreads loose or hold it together using a hair band.</p><p class=align-left>This style is, however, is costly to maintain as opposed to other black men hairstyles as you have to retouch your dreads from time to time to make it look neat. If you are tired of your same old short buzz office style, you can choose to wear this style for a while, but make sure you observe the first law of power by Robert Green; never outshine your master.</p><h3>9. Temp fade</h3><p class=align-left>Temp fade is a preferred hairstyle for black men with medium to short sized hair. It is characterized by a slight fade right after the forehead on the sides of your head, forming an arc followed by a sharp cut on the front hairline. Also, you should trim the hair at the back of your head. A few of the world’s top artists have spotted this hairstyle including J-Cole.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1a31a58f44080ce9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bowl cut girl ideas - 20+ pictures</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/619927f80b919c6f.jpg><p class=align-left>Locally, many artists and ordinary Kenyans are rocking this style. The trick to achieving the perfect temp fade look is to get your hair to the right height, then using the right shaving tools, i.e., electric clippers, form an arc on the side of your head; beginning from your forehead to a few inches before reaching your ear. Alternatively, you can find a good barber to work on your hair.</p><h3>10. Modern buzz cut fade</h3><p class=align-left>Finding the best black men’s hairstyles for gray hair can be a bit challenging. The buzz cut fade is one of the gray hair safe havens. Characterized by a slightly longer hair top, and a tapering fade on the sides and the back of your head, the buzz cut fade is well suited for anyone with gray hair.</p><p class=align-left>This style is achieved by buzzing the shaver on the top of the head in a repetitive manner, to get a perfect and uniform cut. On the sides, the fade can be achieved by changing the gauge of the electric clipper, from the lowest to the highest to get a perfect taper. The appeal of the style shadows the grey hair, by making the hairstyle more conspicuous than the gray hair.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0fgjhs3ntmhtg5atc.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>60 messy hairstyles for men trending in 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left>READ ALSO: Best hairstyles for men in Kenya</p><p class=align-left>Black men hairstyles are quite a number.
