Founded in 2013,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sailfish Brewing Company</a>&nbsp;sources local ingredients and collaborates with regional farmers, chefs and craftspeople to turn out refreshing flavors for visitors and locals alike. “By sharing our love of the coast in everything we make and do, Sailfish connects people to the place, the brand and each other,” says general manager Taylor Welchel.</p><p>130 N.

Owner and operating partner Mitch Timoteo’s father founded the first location in Port St. Lucie 10 years ago, and the Stuart location launched in 2015. Grab a seat early to dive into lemon ricotta pancakes (breakfast is served all day) or a roasted turkey, apple and brie panini.

Owner Carson Novins’ favorite on the menu is the Caprese Burger, topped with fresh mozzarella, marinated tomato and balsamic reduction. Not just a great place for meat, it’s also a great place to meet. In addition to Best Burger, Carsons won in the Best Hangout For Singles category. That’s because its live music and expansive bar set the perfect scene for mingling.</p><p>2883 SE Ocean Blvd., Stuart / 772.286.7611 /&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">carsonstav.com</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/03/szlVugTkcpRAl6urG39k4SfsUpY1YYNN1nWwZb5rotYzgu_SUgEG2F8lS67Wrov6KN5MeEobtqTq7ZGxGQyf20.jpg alt width=740 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>BEST COCKTAIL/RESTAURANT FOR DINNER/SERVICE/HAPPY HOUR</h3><p><strong>The Gafford</strong></p><p>Perhaps one reason to visit The Gafford is to be treated like family. “It sounds cliche, but it’s real,” proprietor Rick Wilson assures of the restaurant’s quality service. He opened the restaurant in 2012 alongside his wife, Elizabeth, and son, Taylor. The winner in four of our categories serves up food with a southern flair. With rave reviews, The Gafford prides itself on its handcrafted, old-school cocktails, such as the Espresso Martini—a perfect way to toast the evening.</p><p>47 SW Flagler Ave. / 772.221.9517 /&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">thegafford.com</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/03/Gilberts-Coffee-Chart-Room-by-Nathan-Venzara-5.jpg alt width=740 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>BEST COFFEE/PLACE TO WORK</h3><p><strong>Gilbert’s Coffee Bar</strong></p><p>With a little less than a year at Sunset Bay Marina & Anchorage, Gilbert’s Coffee Bar has already made a lasting impression in Stuart. Owner Abigail Rogan is on a mission to offer guests fresh, locally sourced food and specialty roasts. She does so by sourcing gourmet toasts from local, organic farms, coffee from Wells Coffee Company in Fort Lauderdale, and high-quality vegan syrups and alternative milks. “Coffee is the medium in which we have the pleasure of serving our community,” Rogan says. “This passion and love of service is what truly makes our coffee stand apart from the rest.”</p><p>615 SW Anchorage Way, Stuart / 772.214.1522 /&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">gilbertscoffeebar.com</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/03/SAS1.jpg alt width=740 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>BEST EVENT</h3><p><strong>Stuart Air Show</strong></p><p>What started as a fundraiser for the Council on Aging in Martin County has turned into a 30-year tradition and the biggest event on the Treasure Coast. We’re talking about the Stuart Air Show, of course, which brings families from near and far to “ooh” and “aah” as some of the most exciting aircraft whiz by. This year will offer two air shows with the first taking place on July 4.</p><p>2400 SE Monterey Road, Ste. 300 / 772.781.4882 /&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">stuartairshow.com</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/03/Harbour-Bay-Florist-Photo.jpg alt width=740 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>BEST FLORIST</h3><p><strong>Harbour Bay Florist & Events</strong></p><p>Linda Oliver was an independent wedding and event planner, often relying on Harbour Bay Florist and Events for help. But in 2013, the owner was retiring and approached Oliver about purchasing the business. “I unhesitatingly said ‘yes,’” she recalls. The company offers florals for weddings, baby or bridal showers, bar/bat mitzvahs, anniversaries, funerals or birthday parties. Oliver is excited to serve the community from a new location in the “pink” building on the route of the Stuart Christmas Parade.</p><p>1500 SE Ocean Blvd, Stuart / 772.221.1009 /&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">harbourbayflorist.com</a></p><h3>BEST GOLF SPOT</h3><p><strong>PGA Golf Club</strong></p><p>PGA Golf Club, the flagship property of the Professional Golfers’ Association in Port St. Lucie, wins this category for a second year in a row.

Stuart’s only barre, Pilates, yoga, and PiYo studio has gained immense popularity since its inception in 2012. “We offer a varied program of well-designed formats, delivered by the best-trained instructors who are passionate about their work and deliver fun, safe classes every day to women of all fitness levels,” says owner and founder Rita Jenkins-Wolcott. With dozens of classes offered weekly, anyone who steps in is bound to find a workout they love while feeling right at home. “Words don’t really capture the incredible vibe and atmosphere in the studio,” Jenkins-Wolcott says. “Our clients are so welcoming, supportive and accepting of one another.”</p><p>2468 SE Federal Highway, Stuart / 772.266.8069 /&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">bolderbarre.com</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2020/03/LIZ_0967-HDR.jpg alt width=740 height=500 sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3>BEST JEWELER</h3><p><strong>Eric Michaels Fine Jewelry</strong></p><p>Eric Michaels Fine Jewelry began a decade ago with four storefront Gold and Diamond Buying locations.
