While a lot of us were busy partying until dawn, figuring out what we wanted from our careers and friends and making bad romantic choices, Miller’s were spent doing similar in a different, high-profile circle – just her life decisions were fiercely judged and met with a disproportionate moral disproval that a male actor in her position would never have had to endure.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And then there’s the intense harassment she faced from the press – she was chased down the street by photographers late at night; paparazzi spat at her and shouted vile insults in a bid to provoke a reaction that they could capture; and, most famously, her phones were hacked by the News of the World and her voicemails intercepted for stories that were published in the paper, prompting her to feel intense paranoia and anxiety.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"With age comes wisdom and a sense of self that’s really relieving"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For some, bafflingly, this still won’t be enough to prompt sympathy. Of course, Miller still led a very glamorous life, but – it should be noted – at a huge cost. Now 36 and a mother, she couldn’t be happier to have left her twenties in the past.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“With age comes wisdom and a sense of self that’s really relieving,” she told us. “I was a little bit at sea in my twenties. I had an amazing time, but I had no roots – well nothing grounded. I got pregnant at 29 and had a daughter at 30 so it all kind of collided in the most fantastic way. With every year that passes I feel more comfortable in myself. That’s not to say I don’t still have existential crises, but I have a way of navigating them that I didn’t have before and I’m aspiring to get even better at that.”</p><img alt="Sienna Miller" title="Sienna Miller" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dmb-formula-e-rome-gala-dinner001-1524227203.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Miller at a Formula E black tie event in Rome</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Miller leads a calmer life now. She is based in New York where she lives with her daughter, Marlowe – who she credits with having “grounded” her. She remains good friends with Marlowe’s father, Tom Sturridge, despite their relationship ending in 2015. Her career is at a high, following a critically acclaimed run as Maggie in last year’s theatre adaptation of Cat On A Hot Tin Roof (“the hardest thing I have ever done bar none”) and this year sees the release of indie drama, Burning Woman, in which she stars alongside Christina Hendricks. The actress is supposed to be taking a break, but you get the impression that she's the sort of person who finds it hard to sit still for long.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Hollywood has changed a lot since Miller’s last film, The Lost City of Z, in early 2017. Following the Weinstein scandal which broke in October last year, there has been a highly-publicised uprising against the systemic sexual harassment and gender inequalities that exist in the film industry and beyond. It’s a subject that Miller feels passionately about and in March she delivered a speech at a UN event in New York in which she hailed the “wave of change”, describing how she was forced to turn down a desirable Broadway role after finding out that her co-star was being paid more than half of her salary for the run.</p><img alt="Spring dressing inspiration" title="Spring dressing inspiration" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sienna-miller-1523965690.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Miller at a Formula E race in April 2018</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Everybody has experienced gender inequality within this industry,” she says firmly. “It’s totally corrupt, as has been exposed. For me, it’s been about pay disparity mostly and just generally being treated differently by the media based on my gender.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But, she says, the impassioned and pivotal Time’s Up movement has inspired a new attitude among industry big shots, whether directors or producers, to treat women fairly. She also highlights a rise in interested, nuanced female roles, naming Oscar-winning films Lady Bird and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri as examples.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I think people are very scared right now; people are afraid to behave in a way that they have in the past,” she says. “One way of addressing pay disparity is the way Paul Newman did - that everyone should acknowledge what they’re being paid. It’s difficult though – it’s greyer than it’s being advertised. Obviously, if someone is clearly a movie star with a big pull then they should get a higher salary. But the fact is now that there are more roles for women and, while it used to be that the man was the star and the woman would have a supporting role, people are much more nervous about casting women in these fluffy, filler roles as love interests or girlfriends.”</p><img alt="Sienna Miller" title="Sienna Miller" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/17/08/1487682085-sienna-miller.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Another way that Hollywood and fame has evolved since Miller was starting out is in relation to privacy laws – which she was instrumental in changing. In 2008, she used human rights legislation to sue the paparazzi for “a campaign of harassment”, which she won. In 2011, she testified in the Leveson enquiry, in which she described the abuse she faced as a young woman in her twenties – a case that, again, she won. The News of the World had tapped her phone to find news stories. She had no idea who was leaking information to the press, even sitting down with her best friend, boyfriend and sister to ask if they were behind it all.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It got to a point where I felt I could no longer live a life like that, so I fought the law,” she says. “I got very legal. It was bittersweet when I won – it wasn’t a pleasant experience to go through; it’s nothing I’d ever want to repeat. It was awful. It meant that I now have a certain protection in this realm which I’ve worked very hard for.”</p><img alt="Sienna Miller Jude Law" title="Sienna Miller Jude Law" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sienna-miller-1524221553.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Miller with Jude Law in 2004</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The experience has left its mark on Miller. She recently watched the 2013 documentary Amy, which shows the extent of how the press relentlessly pursued and trolled the late Amy Winehouse when she was at her lowest.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Having been someone who was totally exposed and harassed, I don’t think it exists the way now that it did then – it reached a fever pitch of craziness,” she says. “I was watching that Amy Winehouse documentary recently and I had a panic attack. It brought back all those feelings, how aggressive it all was. It was really, just not pleasant. You don’t ask for that, but it’s there.”</p><img alt="Sienna Miller at the Serpentine Summer party" title="Sienna Miller at the Serpentine Summer party" width=2212 height=3318 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/16/27/1467875452-sienna-miller-serpentines.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Today, Miller is able to smell the roses more. “Food, wine and friends” are her prerequisites for a good time; a simple formula that’s in full swing when we meet at a Formula E race, the electric car version of Formula 1, in Rome, surrounded by a small group of her closest friends. It might at first glance seem like an unlikely place to find her, but she’s very into cars, loves driving and says that the company’s focus on sustainability is a big draw.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s environmentally friendly and that’s important to me,” she says. “I’ve worked with lots of environment-focused charities, so I am interested in that and the technology for the cars that we’ll be driving in the future is being devised here and that’s incredible. It’s a part of how the world is changing for the better. To see that and to experience that is great; I’ve learnt so much about the sport. It’s very tactical and it’s a great idea.”</p><img alt="Sienna Miller" title="Sienna Miller" width=3000 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-946147568-1524221913.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Miller at a Formula E race in April 2018</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While Miller is all about the future, there’s one area of modern life that she won’t ever get on board with – social media. Given how much she suffered through public and media scrutiny, this is no big surprise. She joined Instagram briefly in 2017, but - although her account still exists - she’s abandoned it already. For someone who is so genuine and open, the balancing act between giving away a little without giving away too much isn’t something she wanted to deal with.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Everybody said you should be on it, ‘the world’s changing and you’re a dinosaur’, which got insulting,” she laughed. “I’m not really good at not being incredibly open and authentic and don’t want be that in front of a bunch of people I don’t know. At the same time, I didn’t want to be inauthentic either, so it was a double-edged sword.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I also find Instagram a huge time waster, so I deleted the app because every time I’d go for a pee or get in a cab, I’d check it,” she added. “There’s a whole world going on out there that I’m not engaging with because I’m mindlessly thumbing through it. So, I think I’m going to get rid of that and regress first to a Blackberry, then working my way back to a flip phone.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"I was watching that Amy Winehouse documentary recently and I had a panic attack"<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fashion is another way the world knows Sienna Miller; particularly influential were her boho days in the early Noughties when everyone bought Ugg boots, disc belts and peasant tops in the hope of looking just a little like her. Now in her mid-thirties, her look – like most of us – has changed. She’s more relaxed and a touch more refined than in her younger days – except for when she's on the school run, when she says that she wears her workout gear to give the illusion she’s off to the gym. In reality she just goes home: “I really admire people who can put on a full look, but I am not one of them.”</p><img alt="Sienna Miller" title="Sienna Miller" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sienna-miller-1524222119.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Rex</span><p>Miller at 2004 Glastonbury</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She’s not big on dressing up for red-carpet events (“Maybe I associate it with the anxiety of the experience you’re about to have in that gown”) and her standard uniform is jeans, jumper and a T-shirt.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I never used to mind drawing attention to myself through what I wore,” she says of her boho stage. “I didn’t mind being quite brave and colourful and I don’t want that anymore.
