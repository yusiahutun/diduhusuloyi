In fact, she’s ready to dole out advice, as she has “so much experience to share.”</p><p>“I hope to lead by example. If I can live in my truth, go through the storm, love myself unconditionally — people will see that. That energy is contagious, and I plan to share it with as many people as possible. I want to especially lift up young women and encourage them to support one another rather than judge each other,” she told the outlet.</p><h3><strong>Meet Jaye Cherry, Rain Spencer Mother</strong></h3><p>On Mother’s Day 2018, Rain Spencer celebrated her mom Carla Cherry or Jaye Cherry via an IG post.
