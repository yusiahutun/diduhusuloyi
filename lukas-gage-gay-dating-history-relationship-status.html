But this isn’t the reason we’re here today.</p><p>Given Lukas’s multiple on-screen gay roles, many are still quite confused if the actor is gay in real life! Furthermore, fans want to hear all about all the star’s dating history and current relationship status., which we’ll be discussing below!</p><h3><strong>Is Lukas Gage Gay?</strong></h3><p>No, Lukas Gage is not gay.</p><p>So, why did the actor have so many rumors about him being one? Well, it all started from the comments over socials — IG, TikTok, etc. One would just hint at how well he portrays the gender and the other would assume the former comment confirmed him as gay. And so on…</p><p>Also, the rumors have a lot to do with the fact that Lukas has so many gay roles including the one on <i>Tagged, Euphoria</i>, and <i>White Lotus</i>. And not to mention Lukas’ “shocking” gay s*x scene with Murray Bartlett on White Lotus, that didn’t help his case at all!</p><p>According to Murray, the two were just being “playful” on set, at the time.</p><p>With this being said, Lukas does support gay rights. He started his career after defending one of his gay friends. At age 18, Lukas and his friend were out partying when suddenly a bunch of guys beats up his friend for being gay. Naturally, Lukas jumped in to protect him, only to get beat up too.</p><p>“I broke my orbitals, my nose, my jaw … eight of my teeth got knocked out. I (had to get) my face put back together,” the actor recalled.</p><p>So, as he lay on a hospital bed, Lukas had this epiphany “If I die, will I have done everything I wanted to do?” He remembered that he was never happy in school and away wanted to pursue acting. And that was when the You star made up his mind to follow his dreams.</p><h3><strong>Lukas Gage Dating History</strong></h3><p>Lukas Gage has dated quite a few stars in the past. Here’s a brief dive into the actor’s dating history.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Lulu Antariksa (Rumor)</strong></h4></li></ul><p><span>Though it was never confirmed, Lukas reportedly dated his <i>Tagged</i> co-star Lulu in 2016.</span><span> The two were always super friendly and even called themselves “Browan” ( Brandon + Rowan, their respective character from the show). Well, Lulu is now engaged to the love of her life Mark Finster (a video maker). But the two were still on good terms.</span></p><ul><li><h4><strong>Emma Dumont (Rumor)</strong></h4></li></ul><p>After Lulu came Lukas’ budding romance with another <i>Tagged </i>co-star Emma. Towards the end of 2017, the duo got very close, and never missed out on sharing each other pics over their respective socials.</p><p>But once again, Lukas’ kept his dating life a mystery. However, he did once joke about dating Emma over his IG story. We have no idea if it was a joke or something more.</p><p>Emma reportedly went on to date a music artist named Vardaan Arora later.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Claudia Sulewski</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Lukas dated the IG star and actress Claudia for a short time in 2018.
