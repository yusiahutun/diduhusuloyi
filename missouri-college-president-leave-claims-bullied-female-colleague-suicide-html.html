Candia-Bailey on the day she took her own life, sent at 6:15am, where she reportedly said Moseley had caused 'enough harm and mental damage.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She claimed that he joked about her struggles with mental health, and outlined a 'series of issues' with the university's leadership including misconduct by the Moseley's advisory council and a toxic work environment.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Feeling she was being 'intentionally harassed and bullied', Candia-Bailey said Moseley 'ignored requests' when she raised issues, and 'when face-to-face, danced around the topic.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was also alleged that when Candia-Bailey made complaints about her treatment to the Board of Curators, the board president brushed off her struggles, and merely responded: 'Please be advised the Board of Curators does not engage in the management of personnel issues for Lincoln University and will not be taking further action related to this issue.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Documents seen by <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>KRCG</a>&nbsp;also detailed
