New technologies and developments are disrupting the industry in multiple ways and companies have to be farsighted to survive the constantly-increasing competition. Excelling in the competition, <a href=# rel=noopener>Behag Overseas</a> is a new generation Logistics company with young and dynamic people, who are not only experienced but dedicated to customer service 24×7.&nbsp;The company is approved by the GOVT of India as CUSTOMS HOUSE AGENT. It operates from Kolkata and has its branches at all land customs ports in West Bengal with associates all over India and abroad.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Initial Blockades along the Way</h2><p>Behag Overseas has a unique perspective on the hurdles it faced, it does not feel that those hurdles were challenges, but “enjoyment” instead. The company feels unless it enjoys its own work, it will not be able to sustain the business. Logistics, especially dealing with international logistics is a very big playground.&nbsp;Since its inception, Behag Overseas has recognized that even though a small player, it is stronger than the big ones. This is the reason it is able to sustain the market for the last ten-fifteen years.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Turning Point-Behag Overseas</h3><p>Behag Overseas provided feedback to its valued customers even on government holidays.&nbsp;</p><p>When the entire world was under COVID for the last two years, the company did not take a single day as rest or holiday.

Behag Overseas also started to make a 4000 sq. feet modern warehouse of its own with a 3000 sq. foot open place at Bangoan and Bashirhat.
