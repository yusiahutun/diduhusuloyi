He made the heartbreaking confession in his own words.</strong></p><p><a href=#>Prince Harry</a> and William walking behind their mom’s coffin on the tragic day of her funeral has been etched into fan’s minds everywhere. The grieving brothers, standing brave, walked behind the hearse in the procession on that fateful morning on September 6, 1997. The Final Journey of the cortege began at Kensington Palace, the <a href=#>royal</a>‘s former home. It travelled along the high street and past the albert Memorial before traveling through London’s Hyde Park. The funeral was broadcast to hundreds of thousands of mourners who came to say goodbye to the <a href=#>People’s Princess – Diana</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-diana-s-funeral-saying-goodbye-to-the-people-s-princess>Diana’s funeral – saying goodbye to the People’s Princess</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-150531533-694x1024.jpg><p>Her coffin was escorted by mounted police before an official ceremony was held at Westminster Abbey.</p><p>Two thousand people attended the serviced to pay their respects to the beloved royal. It’s believed as many as 2.5 billion people watched it worldwide, making it the biggest event to be watched on <a href=#>television</a> in history.</p><p>Despite the outpouring of grief, it wasn’t a state funeral, but instead a royal ceremonial funeral.</p><p>Princess Diana’s coffin was escorted by eight members of the Welsh Guards for the 107-minute ride through the streets, where her fans stood to say goodbye. A letter from a young Harry lay on her coffin, with the envelope being addressed to ‘Mummy’.</p><p>At St James’ Palace, the late Prince Philip – husband to <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a>, walked with her brother the Earl Spencer, Diana’s brother and the then Prince of Wales (Charles). Young <a href=#>Prince William</a> and Harry also joined them as they walked slowly behind her coffin.</p><p>In Harry’s memoir <a href=# rel=nofollow>Spare</a>, he revealed that several adults were ‘horrified’ by the idea that the boys would walk behind the hearse. He also claimed there were suggestions William should walk alone, but Harry wouldn’t allow it. He said if the roles had been reversed, his brother Willy – as he calls him – would have done the same for him.</p><p>Her grave sits on an island within the grounds of Althorp Park, the Spencer family and <a href=#>Diana’s childhood home.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-news-that-broke-the-world>The news that broke the world</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-52100849-1024x686.jpg><p>Princess Diana died on August 31, 1997, following a tragic car crash in the Pond de L’Alma tunnel in Paris. Her driver was attempting to flee the paparazzi that were following them. The driver survived the accident, but Dodi Fayed, who was in the car, also died.</p><p>The sudden death of the popular royal figure stopped the world in it’s tracks. Thousands of flowers, candles, cards and messages lay outside Kensington Palace for several months.</p><p>On September 5, the Queen paid tribute in a live television broadcast, and the next day, Buckingham Palace flew the Union Jack flag at half mast.</p><p><a href=#>Elton John</a>‘s single, Candle in the Wind, was re-written as a tribute, and released as a single. All proceeds from the song have gone to Diana’s charities.</p><p>Her brother, Lord Spencer gave a moving eulogy, and said: “She proved in the last year that she needed no royal title to continue to generate her particular brand of magic.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-believes-there-could-have-been-another-reality-where-princess-diana-would-have-survived>Harry believes there could have been another reality where Princess Diana would have survived</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/09/GettyImages-1682210741-1024x683.jpg><p>In his memoir, released in January this year, Harry spoke dearly of his mother.</p><p>He has often opened up over the loss he had to face as a young child. Whether that was in his mental health TV show, The Me You Can’t See, or fears for his wife <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>‘s well-being inside The Firm.</p><p>One passage in his book, in his own words, detailed his deepest thoughts.</p><p>After the funeral of his <a href=#>grandfather, Prince Philip</a>, he recalled fond memories growing up. Recalling hilarious headlines from the press, one stood out as it focused on his growing glowing beard. He writes his new facial hair “had been causing concern in the family and controversy in the press.” But Philip wasn’t too fussed.</p><p>“Grandpa looked at my mate, looked at my chin, broke into a devilish grin. That’s no beard!”</p><p>It urged him to look further back into his childhood.</p><p>“I thought of Grandpa’s strong opinions, his many passions – carriage driving, barbecuing, shooting, food, beer. The way he embraced life.</p><p>“He had that in common with my mother. Maybe that was why he’d been such a fan. Long before she was Princess Diana, back when she was simply Diana Spencer, kindergarten teacher, secret girlfriend of Prince Charles, my grandfather was her loudest advocate.”</p><p>He adds: “But for him, I wouldn’t be here.</p><p>“Neither would my older brother.</p><p>“Then again, maybe our mother would be here. If she hadn’e married Pa…”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-life-of-service-and-sacrifice>A life of service and sacrifice</h2><p>Harry is referring to the idea that if Princess Diana never married into the royal family, perhaps the press frenzy and paparazzi wouldn’t have happened at all.</p><p>If she continued on with her life and settled down, newspapers and loyal fans across the world wouldn’t have known who she was.</p><p>Diana took her role as an advocate for those who needed it most seriously. She was loved, <a href=#>not for the tiara she wore, but for the work she championed</a> up until her final days.</p><p>Therefore, this part of Di wouldn’t have ever disappeared, but being caught up in the media and her every move watched around the world wouldn’t have been what we know it was then.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2Z%2BcLzRoqWcnV2drrO%2B2GaZnqSZmsOmv4yopZ5lmJqus8DBq5yao5mjtG7A0a6roWWTpMKtsIyhmK%2BdXaiut7HDZpuimZ6WwG64yJ%2BcaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fprince-harry-believes-one-heartbreaking-truth-could-have-saved-dianas-life.html&text=Prince%20Harry%20believes%20one%20heartbreaking%20truth%20could%20have%20saved%20Diana%27s%20life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprince-harry-believes-one-heartbreaking-truth-could-have-saved-dianas-life.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprince-harry-believes-one-heartbreaking-truth-could-have-saved-dianas-life.html&title=Prince%20Harry%20believes%20one%20heartbreaking%20truth%20could%20have%20saved%20Diana%27s%20life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fprince-harry-believes-one-heartbreaking-truth-could-have-saved-dianas-life.html&title=Prince%20Harry%20believes%20one%20heartbreaking%20truth%20could%20have%20saved%20Diana%27s%20life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fprince-harry-believes-one-heartbreaking-truth-could-have-saved-dianas-life.html&title=Prince%20Harry%20believes%20one%20heartbreaking%20truth%20could%20have%20saved%20Diana%27s%20life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprince-harry-believes-one-heartbreaking-truth-could-have-saved-dianas-life.html&description=Prince%20Harry%20believes%20one%20heartbreaking%20truth%20could%20have%20saved%20Diana%27s%20life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./songwriter-rachel-bissex-48-dies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Songwriter, Rachel Bissex, 48, Dies">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-mat-fraser-finds-retirement-crossfit-rewarding-competing.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Mat Fraser finds retirement from CrossFit as rewarding as competing, by striving for perfecti">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
