Get to know the talented ladies that make up the Hocus Pocus cast!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bette Midler as Winifred Sanderson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Copy-of-side-by-side-2023-10-13T120259.881.png><p>Midler led the Hocus Pocus cast as Winifred Sanderson, and boy did she do it well! “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">If there was a third one, of course I’d sign on</a>, but I don’t know how,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bette Midler</a> told Entertainment Weekly. “I can’t imagine what the story would be, but I love Winifred, Sarah, Mary, and our relationship. It’s good for women. We stick together through hell and high water, but we do cause mayhem, and not many women cause that much mayhem!”</p><p>Midler has always been a proponent for strong female relationships.&nbsp;Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, The Divine Miss M, as she’s sometimes called, has over five decades in the entertainment field, having received numerous accolades, including four Golden Globes, three Grammy Awards, three Primetime Emmys, two Tony Awards and a Kennedy Center Honor.&nbsp;</p><p>Midler began her career in off-Broadway and then segued to Broadway in the late 1960s.&nbsp;With her tone and perfect pitch, Midler began singing in the New York City Continental Baths, a local gay bathhouse, with Barry Manilow as her pianist.&nbsp;Since her prominence in 1970, she has released 14 studio albums as a solo artist.</p><p>She made her acting debut with The Rose in 1979, bringing home the Golden Globe for a movie based on Janis Joplin’s troubled life.&nbsp;Midler went on to star in numerous films such as Beaches, The First Wives Club and The Addams Family.&nbsp;The hit Beaches not only was a success for her acting talent, but the accompanying soundtrack remains Midler’s all-time best seller, which featured her biggest hit, Wind Beneath My Wings.&nbsp;At the 2014 Academy Awards, Midler performed her big hit during the “in memoriam” tribute.</p><p>More recently, Midler portrayed Bella Abzug in the 2020 biographical film, The Glorias, and also starred in the second season of The Politician the same year.&nbsp;This year, she starred in Sitting In Bars With Cake.&nbsp;(Read about our favorite <a href=#>Bette Midler movies</a>.)</p><p>Midler is very active on the charity scene, having been an early sponsor of Adopt-a-Highway in Burbank, California.&nbsp;The project was so popular that she carried the idea to the east coast, adopting a section of the Long Island Expressway.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kathy Najimy as Mary Sanderson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Copy-of-side-by-side-2023-10-13T120719.631.png><p>Born in San Diego, California, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kathy Najimy</a> was first nationally known for her feminist play The Kathy and Mo Show that she wrote and performed with Mo Gaffney.&nbsp;On film, she is best known for her roles in Soapdish (1991), Sister Act and its sequel, and later Hocus Pocus and its sequel.&nbsp;She has played everything from Mae West on Broadway’s Dirty Blonde to the evil queen in Disney’s Descendants.&nbsp;</p><p>Off camera, Najimy is an activist and frequently travels the country speaking on issues of equal rights, safety and self-esteem for women and girls, domestic violence, body image and civil rights.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Sarah Jessica Parker as Sarah Sanderson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/Copy-of-side-by-side-2023-10-13T120915.675.png><p>Probably best known for her role as Carrie Bradshaw in Sex and the City, for which she brought home numerous awards, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sarah Jessica Parker</a> later reprised the role in the films as well as the revival series And Just Like That from 2021 to the present day.&nbsp;Parker, born in Nelsonville, Ohio, made her Broadway debut at the age of 11 in The Innocents before going on to star in the title role of Broadway’s Annie in 1979.&nbsp;</p><p>As a young girl, Parker attended the School of American Ballet and the School for Creative and Performing Arts.&nbsp;“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The arts were a big part of my childhood</a>.&nbsp;We went to the theatre and opera a lot as a family,” she told Female First. “We weren’t wealthy, but it was at a time when the arts were publicly funded and there were free tickets available.&nbsp;For someone like myself who wasn’t that academically inclined, it was a great escape.”&nbsp;</p><p>Film roles became plentiful in the 80s and 90s:&nbsp;L.A. Story, Honeymoon in Vegas, Ed Wood, Miami Rhapsody and then came Hocus Pocus. She teamed up with Hocus co-star Bette Midler in The First Wives Club.&nbsp;Clearly though, it was Sex and The City that made Parker, aka Carrie Bradshaw, a household name.&nbsp;She brought home two Emmys, four Golden Globes and three Screen Actors Guild Awards for this role.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2016, Parker executive produced and starred as Frances Dufresnen in Divorce on HBO, about a married woman who has an affair which precipitates her divorce.&nbsp;“<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">I like that Frances is very real to me</a>,” she told IndieWire. “She’s both honorable and messy.&nbsp;She’s both exacting and untethered, but a very real person.”&nbsp;</p><p>More recently, Parker co-starred with husband Matthew Broderick in the revival of Plaza Suite.&nbsp;Off camera, Parker took on the fashion industry with various endorsements and is also running her own production company, Pretty Matches. She also works on behalf of UNICEF.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What we know about Hocus Pocus 3</h2><p>While the&nbsp;Hocus Pocus 3&nbsp;cast hasn’t been confirmed as of this writing, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s looking fairly likely that the Sanderson Sisters will be back</a>. Midler, Najimy and Parker have all expressed interest in doing&nbsp;Hocus Pocus 3. When speaking on the&nbsp;<a href=#>Hocus Pocus 3&nbsp;possibility</a>, Midler stated she would sign on but questioned where the story could go. Parker shared a similar sentiment: “Of course I’d be happy to have a conversation [for a third film].” It’s hoped that the third Hocus Pocus installment will be released in time for Halloween 2025.</p><p><strong>For more on actresses we love:</strong></p><p><a href=#>Jamie Lee Curtis Movies: A Look Back At the Scream Queen’s Most Memorable Roles</a></p><p><a href=#>Michelle Pfeiffer Young: A Look Back Through Her Glamorous Hollywood Evolution</a></p><p><a href=#>Holly Hunter: From Southern Sweetheart to Hollywood Superstar — Where Is She Now?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJonKeslafBorXNppynrF%2Borq%2BwxKuqqKZdqLa0wMSrqmasmJq7bq3NnWSnp6c%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsanderson-sisters-then-and-now.html&text=The%20Sanderson%20Sisters%20from%20%27Hocus%20Pocus%27%20Then%20and%20Now&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsanderson-sisters-then-and-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsanderson-sisters-then-and-now.html&title=The%20Sanderson%20Sisters%20from%20%27Hocus%20Pocus%27%20Then%20and%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsanderson-sisters-then-and-now.html&title=The%20Sanderson%20Sisters%20from%20%27Hocus%20Pocus%27%20Then%20and%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsanderson-sisters-then-and-now.html&title=The%20Sanderson%20Sisters%20from%20%27Hocus%20Pocus%27%20Then%20and%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsanderson-sisters-then-and-now.html&description=The%20Sanderson%20Sisters%20from%20%27Hocus%20Pocus%27%20Then%20and%20Now" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./actress-amanda-plummer-never-been-married-children-didn-t-find-perfect-husband-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Actress Amanda Plummer: Never Been Married, No Children, Didn't Find Her Perfect Husband?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sam-faiers-black-velvet-dress-zara-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sam Faiers's gorgeous black velvet dress is a total Zara bargain">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
