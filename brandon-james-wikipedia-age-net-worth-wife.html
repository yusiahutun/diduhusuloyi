However, one racer from Southern California took everyone by surprise by winning the show and his name is Brandon James. So, let’s learn more about him with this article.</p><p>This Brandon James Wikipedia discusses his age, net worth, and information on his wife.</p><h3><strong>Brandon James On Street Outlaws</strong></h3><p>Brandon James was never a part of Discovery’s Street Outlaws, but he participated as one of the 64 racers from across the who were invited to take part in the “Mega Cash Days.” He competed in the race against James Finney, Mike Murillo, Ryan Martin, Shawn Ellington, Justin Shearer, Kye Kelley, and other infamous racers from the series.</p><p>Hosted by “BoostedGT” Chris Hamilton, the double-elimination format of Mega Cash Days meant a racer could lose and still advance — and win it all. However, he had no intention to follow the format and went unbeaten, untied, and unscored upon through six rounds of racing.</p><p>He defeated Dennis Bailey in the finale for $100,000 and went home victorious. In total, he pocketed $135,000.</p><p>“We went wanting to win, but the expectation was to go rounds…we certainly didn’t think we were going to win it undefeated. It was never like that, we just wanted to prove that as a team we belonged, and whether we won it or not, have people know who we are,” Brandon revealed.</p><h3><strong>Brandon James Age</strong></h3><p>Brandon James was born on 7 February 1993. He turned 28 years old in February 2021.</p><h3><strong>Does Brandon James Have A Wife?</strong></h3><p>No, Brandon James doesn’t appear to be married to have a wife. He is relatively private when it comes to his details and stayed strictly professional even on his social media platforms. There are no posts that suggested him being in a relationship or has been ever been tagged on his socials by his prospective lovers.</p><p>So, unless he comes out and reveals that he is in a relationship or he has a wife, we would like to assume that he is single at the moment, based on his social media activities.</p><h3><strong>Brandon James Net Worth</strong></h3><p>With the “Mega Cash Day” win, Brandon James added $135,000 more to his burgeoning net worth of over another $200 thousand, making it a total of $335,000.</p><p>Brandon James first delved himself into racing after attending Frank Hawley’s Drag Racing School. Furthermore, his father’s connection with street racer friends also paved way for him to get into racing. He bought a ’56 Chevy Bel Air and campaigned it in B/Gas (an 8.60 index category) on the west coast for a time. Later on, he transitioned to ’68 Mustang that helped him win against the best of the best in the Street Outlaws.</p><p>His journey started just by watching TV which turned into a real-life dream come true.</p><p>“This journey all started with No Prep Kings…that car was just going to be on the track, but things changed and we wanted to race. The street was the next thing, and we had to conquer it,” Brandon says.</p><p>While Brandon had a friendly acceleration competition with his fellow racers in Southern California, he had never tested racing Mustang in the street race. Nevertheless, he join the race with a belief that his Mustang was better than everyone else’s and eventually proved it right.</p><p>Brandon represents Solar Need Racing and is the only driver for the team. Besides racing, the company also provides services such as solar projects, durable and renewable roofing systems, and residential and commercial construction.</p><p>Brandon built his mustang with a California Street Machine that helped power the car with a twin-turbo 421 CID block Chevrolet. The family-owned company specialized in precision machine work and exacting tolerances and has a long history in the racing industry.</p><p>Over the years, he has competed in various tracks. For him, Sacramento is his hometown track only an hour and a half away. He and his team worked hard to make it to every race. The longest he ever drove was 6 hours to be in a race, only to wait 4 days in the rain to never get to race at all.</p><p><strong>Trivia:</strong> Brandon had crashed his car and his friend Dan came for the save. He gave away a 1967 Nova with a screw-blown hemi in it. They worked out on the car, and eventually, Brandon used it for NoPrep.</p><h3><strong>Brandon James Height</strong></h3><p>Brandon James stands tall to the height above 6 feet.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Brandon James On Instagram, Facebook?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>No, Brandon James doesn’t seem to be on Facebook.
