Stay up to date with the latest books or catch up on the classics with these inexpensive and user-friendly book reading apps. What a novel idea!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=update-8-18-22>UPDATE: 8/18/22</h3><p>Verified links and info up to date. Replaced Overdrive with Libby.</p><h2 id=what-to-look-for-in-book-reading-apps>What to Look for in Book Reading Apps</h2><p>The best book reading apps balance tons of functionality while still being just as easy to use as an old-fashioned physical book. Here are a few things to think about as you're finding yourself a good app for reading books:</p><ul><li><strong>A Great Selection:</strong> You probably wouldn't walk into a bookstore if it only had two or three books on the shelves, and book reading apps should be no different. Ideally, these apps should offer <a href=#>hundreds of thousands of e-books</a> across popular genres like YA or nonfiction, or at least give you a way to <a href=#>upload your own books</a>. Bonus points if the app supports additional format choices like audiobooks, magazines, and graphic novels, or allows you to connect to your local library system to access titles that way. Also, if you have lots of <a href=#>avid readers</a> in your household (lucky you!), consider apps with some kind of family library function that'll let every reader on the account access titles others have purchased or uploaded.</li><li><strong>Easy to Use:</strong> As we said earlier, these apps bring tons of fun and genuinely useful functionality to reading a book, but that doesn't mean they should be difficult to navigate. Good book apps should make it easy to find, purchase, or upload a book and start reading it, which means it should have a clean intuitive layout. They should track your progress in a book, allow you to place multiple bookmarks, and allow you to pop out to a bird's-eye view to quickly look ahead in a book or find a passage you already read. They should also have a built-in dictionary and translation option.</li><li><strong>Customization Options:</strong> The ability to customize something is always a plus, and the best reading apps let you adjust fonts, toggle dark or blue-light modes, and even highlight, save, or share a particularly awesome passage.</li><li><strong>Device Compatibility:</strong> Some of these apps are only available for a single platform, while others offer wider compatibility (like on tablets, eReaders, or desktop computers, in addition to the mobile app). Consider which devices you want to read on, and if you plan on reading on multiple devices, choose an app that offers cross-device syncing so you can pick up where you last left off on any device.</li><li><strong>Choices for Storage: </strong>Your digital books will either be stored locally on your device or via cloud storage. Consider how much storage you have on your device and whether or not you want to have cross-platform availability if you read on multiple devices. Typically, these apps don't charge for their proprietary cloud storage of your books or allow you to connect your own cloud storage option, so beware of apps asking for money each month for cloud storage.</li><li><strong>Fair Prices: </strong>While the apps themselves are free, the content isn't. Expect new and popular books to be the priciest options and, likewise, don't be surprised to see older and less-popular books to cost very little or possibly nothing. Bonus points to apps that have fair pricing and aren't afraid to hold regular sales and offer good deals in between sales, or that allow you to upload books you've already acquired yourself.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=best-overall-amazon-kindle-android-and-iphone>Best Overall: Amazon Kindle (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone</a>)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4044dac8.png> <a href=#>Amazon</a><p>With over a million e-books on hand and thousands of audiobooks, magazines, and comic books, Amazon Kindle (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone</a>) has something for everyone. If you're unsure of what you want to read, check out personalized recommendations and up-to-date charts displaying what's popular right now. It also offers tons of deals wherein you can save up to 80% off on books from all genres---from sci-fi and romance to nonfiction and YA thrillers---and you can even borrow books from your local library.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amazon Kindle works on Android and iOS devices as well as on Mac and PC, so you can keep reading no matter which device you're using.

As you read, you can translate foreign language passages and look up definitions and Wikipedia entries for words you don't recognize. And if you struggle remembering specific character names, events, or places within a book, don't fret---Amazon Kindle's X-Ray feature gives a brief reminder of what something is, contextually, with just a tap. The Word Wise feature, once turned on, shows short and simple definitions for words above difficult words, which is a great feature to have when reading difficult texts or if you're reading a book not in your native language.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Adjusting the font type and size of your text, along with customizing text alignment, margin spacing, brightness, and the background color is easy to do. And dark mode for reading under the covers with a flashlight? No problem. The Kindle app also shows you how much time you have left in a chapter based on your speed and lets you add multiple bookmarks, highlight and annotate passages, skip around via bird's-eye view, and even <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">switch over to Audible mode</a> when you're (sort of) busy, so you can keep reading (listening) when you're driving or cooking dinner.</p><h2 id=best-for-android-and-google-users-google-play-books-android-and-iphone>Best for Android (and Google) Users: Google Play Books (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone</a>)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/b7a11e5a.png> <a href=#>Google</a><p>Google Play Books (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored nofollow" class="norewrite noskim">Android</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">iPhone</a>) is a beautiful, clean, and super easy-to-use app. Anyone who already uses Google services can jump right in, but the app is also available for Android and iOS users.

The Library tab is (you guessed it) your library, which you can access on any device your account is linked to. Simply scroll through your library to see what you have or search for something more efficiently with its helpful filters. Lastly---the Shop tab.

The sheet music selection isn't quite as robust as that of a dedicated sheet music store, but it's perfect for students and casual musicians who are looking for something fun or new to explore.
